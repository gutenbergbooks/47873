<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The circumstances attending the composition and
publication of the present work have thrown upon me the duty of
furnishing it with a preface explaining its object and scope.</p>
<p class="par">Briefly, the purpose of the author has been to collect
into a Book of Malay Folklore all that seemed to him most typical of
the subject amongst a considerable mass of materials, some of which lay
scattered in the pages of various other works, others in unpublished
native manuscripts, and much in notes made by him personally of what he
had observed during several years spent in the Malay Peninsula,
principally in the State of Selangor. The book does not profess to be
an exhaustive or complete treatise, but rather, as its title indicates,
an introduction to the study of Folklore, Popular Religion, and Magic
as understood among the Malays of the Peninsula.</p>
<p class="par">It should be superfluous, at this time of day, to defend
such studies as these from the criticisms which have from time to time
been brought against them. I remember my old friend and former teacher,
Wan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e249" href="#xd21e249" name=
"xd21e249">viii</a>]</span>&#703;Abdullah, a Singapore Malay of
Trengganu extraction and Arab descent, a devout and learned Muhammadan
and a most charming man, objecting to them on the grounds, first, that
they were useless, and, secondly, which, as he emphatically declared,
was far worse, that they were perilous to the soul&rsquo;s health. This
last is a point of view which it would hardly be appropriate or
profitable to discuss here, but a few words may as well be devoted to
the other objection. It is based, sometimes, on the ground that these
studies deal not with &ldquo;facts,&rdquo; but with mere nonsensical
fancies and beliefs. Now, for facts we all, of course, have the
greatest respect; but the objection appears to me to involve an
unwarrantable restriction of the meaning of the word: a belief which is
actually held, even a mere fancy that is entertained in the mind, has a
real existence, and is a fact just as much as any other. As a piece of
psychology it must always have a certain interest, and it may on
occasions become of enormous practical importance. If, for instance, in
1857 certain persons, whose concern it was, had paid more attention to
facts of this kind, possibly the Indian Mutiny could have been
prevented, and probably it might have been foreseen, so that
precautionary measures could have been taken in time to minimise the
extent of the catastrophe. It is not suggested that the matters dealt
with in this book are ever likely to involve such serious issues; but,
speaking generally, there can be no doubt <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e251" href="#xd21e251" name="xd21e251">ix</a>]</span>that an
understanding of the ideas and modes of thought of an alien people in a
relatively low stage of civilisation facilitates very considerably the
task of governing them; and in the Malay Peninsula that task has now
devolved mainly upon Englishmen. Moreover, every notion of utility
implies an end to which it is to be referred, and there are other ends
in life worth considering as well as those to which the
&ldquo;practical man&rdquo; is pleased to restrict himself. When one
passes from the practical to the speculative point of view, it is
almost impossible to predict what piece of knowledge will be fruitful
of results, and what will not; <i lang="la">prima facie</i>, therefore,
all knowledge has a claim to be considered of importance from a
scientific point of view, and until everything is known, nothing can
safely be rejected as worthless.</p>
<p class="par">Another and more serious objection, aimed rather at the
method of such investigations as these, is that the evidence with which
they have to be content is worth little or nothing. Objectors attempt
to discredit it by implying that at best it is only what A. says that
B. told him about the beliefs B. says he holds, in other words, that it
is the merest hearsay; and it is also sometimes suggested that when A.
is a European and B. a savage, or at most a semi-civilised person of
another breed, the chances are that B. will lie about his alleged
beliefs, or that A. will unconsciously read his own ideas into
B.&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e258" href="#xd21e258"
name="xd21e258">x</a>]</span>confused statements, or that, at any rate,
one way or another, they are sure to misunderstand each other, and
accordingly the record cannot be a faithful one.</p>
<p class="par">So far as this objection can have any application to the
present work, it may fairly be replied: first that the author has been
at some pains to corroborate and illustrate his own accounts by the
independent observations of others (and this must be his justification
for the copiousness of his quotations from other writers); and,
secondly, that he has, whenever possible, given us what is really the
best kind of evidence for his own statements by recording the charms
and other magic formul&aelig; which are actually in use. Of these a
great number has been here collected, and in the translation of such of
the more interesting ones as are quoted in the text of the book, every
effort has been made to keep to literal accuracy of rendering. The
originals will be found in the Appendix, and it must be left to those
who can read Malay to check the author&rsquo;s versions, and to draw
from the untranslated portions such inferences as may seem to them
good.</p>
<p class="par">The author himself has no preconceived thesis to
maintain: his object has been collection rather than comparison, and
quite apart from the necessary limitations of space and time, his
method has confined the book within fairly well-defined bounds. Though
the subject is one which would naturally lend itself to a comparative
treatment, and though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e264" href=
"#xd21e264" name="xd21e264">xi</a>]</span>the comparison of Malay
folklore with that of other nations (more particularly of India,
Arabia, and the mainland of Indo-China) would no doubt lead to very
interesting results, the scope of the work has as far as possible been
restricted to the folklore of the Malays of the Peninsula. Accordingly
the analogous and often quite similar customs and ideas of the Malayan
races of the Eastern Archipelago have been only occasionally referred
to, while those of the Chinese and other non-Malayan inhabitants of the
Peninsula have been excluded altogether.</p>
<p class="par">Moreover, several important departments of custom and
social life have been, no doubt designedly, omitted: thus, to mention
only one subject out of several that will probably occur to the reader,
the modes of organisation of the Family and the Clan (which in certain
Malay communities present archaic features of no common interest),
together with the derivative notions affecting the tenure and
inheritance of property, have found no place in this work. The field,
in fact, is very wide and cannot all be worked at once. The folklore of
uncivilised races may fairly enough be said to embrace every phase of
nature and every department of life: it may be regarded as containing,
in the germ and as yet undifferentiated, the notions from which
Religion, Law, Medicine, Philosophy, Natural Science, and Social
Customs are eventually evolved. Its bulk and relative importance seem
to vary inversely with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e268"
href="#xd21e268" name="xd21e268">xii</a>]</span>advance of a race in
the progress towards civilisation; and the ideas of savages on these
matters appear to constitute in some cases a great and complex system,
of which comparatively few traces only are left among the more
civilised peoples. The Malay race, while far removed from the savage
condition, has not as yet reached a very high stage of civilisation,
and still retains relatively large remnants of this primitive order of
ideas. It is true that Malay notions on these subjects are undergoing a
process of disintegration, the rapidity of which has been considerably
increased by contact with European civilisation, but, such as they are,
these ideas still form a great factor in the life of the mass of the
people.</p>
<p class="par">It may, however, be desirable to point out that the
complexity of Malay folklore is to be attributed in part to its
singularly mixed character. The development of the race from savagery
and barbarism up to its present condition of comparative civilisation
has been modified and determined, first and most deeply by Indian, and
during the last five centuries or so by Arabian influences. Just as in
the language of the Malays it is possible by analysis to pick out words
of Sanskrit and Arabic origin from amongst the main body of genuinely
native words, so in their folklore one finds Hindu, Buddhist, and
Muhammadan ideas overlying a mass of apparently original Malay notions.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e272" href="#xd21e272" name=
"xd21e272">xiii</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">These various elements of their folklore are, however,
now so thoroughly mixed up together that it is often almost impossible
to disentangle them. No systematic attempt has been made to do so in
this book, although here and there an indication of the origin of some
particular myth will be found; but a complete analysis (if possible at
all) would have necessitated, as a preliminary investigation, a much
deeper study of Hindu and Muhammadan mythology than it has been found
practicable to engage in.</p>
<p class="par">In order, however, to give a clear notion of the
relation which the beliefs and practices that are here recorded bear to
the official religion of the people, it is necessary to state that the
Malays of the Peninsula are Sunni Muhammadans of the school of
Shafi&rsquo;i, and that nothing, theoretically speaking, could be more
correct and orthodox (from the point of view of Isl&#257;m) than the
belief which they profess.</p>
<p class="par">But the beliefs which they actually hold are another
matter altogether, and it must be admitted that the Muhammadan veneer
which covers their ancient superstitions is very often of the thinnest
description. The inconsistency in which this involves them is not,
however, as a rule realised by themselves. Beginning their invocations
with the orthodox preface: &ldquo;<i>In the name of God, the merciful,
the compassionate</i>,&rdquo; and ending them with an appeal to the
Creed: &ldquo;<i>There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the Apostle
of God</i>,&rdquo; they are conscious <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e286" href="#xd21e286" name="xd21e286">xiv</a>]</span>of no
impropriety in addressing the intervening matter to a string of Hindu
Divinities, Demons, Ghosts, and Nature Spirits, with a few Angels and
Prophets thrown in, as the occasion may seem to require. Still, the
more highly educated Malays, especially those who live in the towns and
come into direct contact with Arab teachers of religion, are disposed
to object strongly to these &ldquo;relics of paganism&rdquo;; and there
can be no doubt that the increasing diffusion of general education in
the Peninsula is contributing to the growth of a stricter conception of
Isl&#257;m, which will involve the gradual suppression of such of these
old-world superstitions as are obviously of an &ldquo;unorthodox&rdquo;
character.</p>
<p class="par">This process, however, will take several generations to
accomplish, and in the meantime it is to be hoped that a complete
record will have been made both of what is doomed sooner or later to
perish, and of what in all likelihood will survive under the new
conditions of our time. It is as a contribution to such a record, and
as a collection of materials to serve as a sound basis for further
additions and comparisons, that this work is offered to the reader.</p>
<p class="par">A list of the principal authorities referred to will be
found in another place, but it would be improper to omit here the
acknowledgments which are due to the various authors of whose work in
this field such wide use has been made. Among the dead special mention
must be made of Marsden, who will <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e292" href="#xd21e292" name="xd21e292">xv</a>]</span>always be for
Englishmen the pioneer of Malay studies; Leyden, the gifted translator
of the S&#277;jarah Malayu, whose early death probably inflicted on
Oriental scholarship the greatest loss it has ever had to suffer;
Newbold, the author of what is still, on the whole, the best work on
the Malay Peninsula; and Sir William Maxwell, in whom those of us who
knew him have lost a friend, and Malay scholarship a thoroughly sound
and most brilliant exponent.</p>
<p class="par">Among the living, the acknowledgments of the author are
due principally to Sir Frank Swettenham and Mr. Hugh Clifford, who,
while they have done much to popularise the knowledge of things Malay
amongst the general reading public, have also embodied in their works
the results of much careful and accurate observation. The free use
which has been made of the writings of these and other authors will, it
is hoped, be held to be justified by their intrinsic value.</p>
<p class="par">It must be added that the author, having to leave
England about the beginning of this year with the Cambridge scientific
expedition which is now exploring the Northern States of the Peninsula,
left the work with me for revision. The first five Chapters and Chapter
VI., up to the end of the section on Dances, Sports, and Games, were
then already in the printer&rsquo;s hands, but only the first 100 pages
or so had had the benefit of the author&rsquo;s revision. For the
arrangement of the rest of Chapter VI., and for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e298" href="#xd21e298" name=
"xd21e298">xvi</a>]</span>some small portion of the matter therein
contained, I am responsible, and it has also been my duty to revise the
whole book finally. Accordingly, it is only fair to the author to point
out that he is to be credited with the matter and the general scheme of
the work, while the responsibility for defects in detail must fall upon
myself.</p>
<p class="par">As regards the spelling of Malay words, it must be said
that geographical names have been spelled in the way which is now
usually adopted and without diacritical marks: the names of the
principal Native States of the Peninsula (most of which are repeatedly
mentioned in the book) are K&#277;dah, Perak, S&#277;langor,
J&#335;hor, P&#259;hang, Tr&#277;ngganu, K&#277;lantan, and
P&#259;tani. Otherwise, except in quotations (where the spelling of the
original is preserved), an attempt has been made to transliterate the
Malay words found in the body of the book in such a way as to give the
ordinary reader a fairly correct idea of their pronunciation. The
Appendix, which appeals only to persons who already know Malay, has
been somewhat differently treated, diacritical marks being inserted
only in cases where there was a possible ambiguity, and the spelling of
the original MSS. being changed as little as possible.</p>
<p class="par">A perfect transliteration, or one that will suit
everybody, is, however, an unattainable ideal, and the most that can be
done in that direction is necessarily a compromise. In the system
adopted in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e304" href="#xd21e304"
name="xd21e304">xvii</a>]</span>body of the work, the vowels are to be
sounded (roughly speaking) as in Italian, except <i>&#277;</i> (which
resembles the French <i>e</i> in <i>que</i>, <i>le</i>, and the like),
and the consonants as in English (but <i>ng</i> as in <i>singer</i>,
not <i>finger</i>; <i>g</i> as in <i>go</i>; <i>ny</i> as <i>ni</i> in
<i>onion</i>; <i>ch</i> as in <i>church</i>; final <i>k</i> and initial
<i>h</i> almost inaudible). The symbol &#703; represents the Arabic
<i>&#703;ain</i>, and the symbol &rsquo; is used (1) between
consonants, to indicate the presence of an almost inaudible vowel, the
shortest form of <i>&#277;</i>, and elsewhere (2) for the
<i>hamzah</i>, and (3) for the apostrophe, <i>i.e.</i> to denote the
suppression of a letter or syllable. Both the <i>&#703;ain</i> and the
<i>hamzah</i> may be neglected in pronunciation, as indeed they are
very generally disregarded by the Malays themselves. In this and other
respects, Arabic scholars into whose hands this book may fall must not
be surprised to find that Arabic words and phrases suffer some
corruptions in a Malay context. These have not, as a rule, been
interfered with or corrected, although it has not been thought worth
while to preserve obvious blunders of spelling in well-known Arabic
formul&aelig;. It should be added that in Malay the accent or stress,
which is less marked than in English, falls almost invariably on the
penultimate syllable of the word. Exceptions to this rule hardly ever
occur except in the few cases where the penultimate is an <i>open</i>
syllable with a short vowel, as indicated by the sign &#728;.</p>

Malays; most of these models and other objects are now in the Cambridge
Arch&aelig;ological and Ethnological Museum, to which they were
presented by the author.</p>
<p class="par">The Index, for the compilation of which I am indebted to
my wife, who has also given me much assistance in the revision of the
proof-sheets, will, it is believed, add greatly to the usefulness of
the work as a book of reference.</p>

the World</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The theory of the Creation most usually held by
Peninsular Malays is summarised in the following passage, quoted (in
1839) by Lieutenant Newbold from a Malay folk-tale:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From the Supreme Being first emanated light
towards chaos; this light, diffusing itself, became the vast ocean.
From the bosom of the waters thick vapour and foam ascended. The earth
and sea were then formed, each of seven tiers. The earth rested on the
surface of the water from east to west. God, in order to render
steadfast the foundations of the world, which vibrated tremulously with
the motion of the watery expanse, girt it round with an adamantine
chain, viz. the stupendous mountains of Caucasus, the wondrous regions
of genii and aerial spirits. Beyond these limits is spread out a vast
plain, the sand and earth of which are of gold and musk, the stones
rubies and emeralds, the vegetation of odoriferous flowers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From the range of Caucasus all the mountains of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>the earth have their origin as pillars to support
and strengthen the terrestrial framework.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1427src" href="#xd21e1427" name="xd21e1427src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">The Mountains of Caucasus are usually called by Malays
Bukit Kof (<i>i.e.</i> Kaf), or the Mountains of Kaf (which latter is
their Arabic name). These mountains are not unfrequently referred to in
Malay charms, <i>e.g.</i> in invocations addressed to the Rice-Spirit.
The Mountains of Kaf are to the Malays a great range which serves as a
&ldquo;wall&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">dinding</i>) to the earth, and keeps
off both excessive winds and beasts of prey. This wall, however, is
being bored through by people called Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog),
and when they succeed in their task the end of all things will come.
Besides these mountains which surround the earth there is a great
central mountain called Mahameru (Saguntang Maha Biru, or merely
Saguntang-guntang).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1444src" href=
"#xd21e1444" name="xd21e1444src">2</a> In many Malay stories this hill
Mahameru is identified with Saguntang-guntang on the borders of
Palembang in Sumatra.</p>
<p class="par">The account which I shall now give, however, differs
considerably from the preceding. It was taken down by me from an
introduction to a Malay charm-book belonging to a magician (one
&#703;Abdul Razzak of Klang in Selangor), with whom I was acquainted,
but who, though he allowed me to copy it, would not allow me either to
buy or borrow the book:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1451src" href=
"#xd21e1451" name="xd21e1451src">3</a>&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the days when Haze bore Darkness, and Darkness
Haze, when the Lord of the Outer Silence Himself was yet in the womb of
Creation, before the existence of the names of Earth and Heaven, of God
and Muhammad, of the Empyrean and Crystalline <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>spheres, or
of Space and Void, the Creator of the entire Universe pre-existed by
Himself, and He was the Eldest Magician. He created the Earth of the
width of a tray and the Heavens of the width of an umbrella, which are
the universe of the Magician. Now from before the beginning of time
existed that Magician&mdash;that is, God&mdash;and He made Himself
manifest with the brightness of the moon and the sun, which is the
token of the True Magician.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The account proceeds to describe how God &ldquo;created
the pillar of the Ka&#703;bah,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1460src"
href="#xd21e1460" name="xd21e1460src">4</a> which is the Navel of the
Earth, whose growth is comparable to a Tree, ... whose branches are
four in number, and are called, the first, &lsquo;Sajeratul
Mentahar,&rsquo; and the second &lsquo;Taubi,&rsquo; and the third,
&lsquo;Khaldi,&rsquo; and the fourth &lsquo;Nasrun &#703;Alam,&rsquo;
which extend unto the north, south, east, and west, where they are
called the Four Corners of the World.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Next we read that the word of God Almighty came in
secret to Gabriel, saying, &ldquo;Take me down the iron staff of the
&lsquo;Creed&rsquo; which dangles at the gate of heaven, and kill me
this serpent Sakatimuna.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1474src"
href="#xd21e1474" name="xd21e1474src">5</a> Gabriel did so, and the
serpent brake asunder, the head and forepart shooting up above the
heavens, and the tail part penetrating downwards beneath the
earth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1483src" href="#xd21e1483" name=
"xd21e1483src">6</a> The rest of the account is taken up with a
description, that need not here be repeated, of the transformation of
all the various parts of the serpent&rsquo;s anatomy, which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>are represented as turning with a few exceptions
into good and evil genii.</p>
<p class="par">The most curious feature of the description is perhaps
the marked anthropomorphic character of this serpent, which shows it to
be a serpent in little more than name. It seems, in fact, very probable
that we have here a reminiscence of the Indian
&ldquo;Naga.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1496src" href=
"#xd21e1496" name="xd21e1496src">7</a> Thus we find the rainbow (here
divided into its component parts) described as originating from the
serpent&rsquo;s sword with its hilt and cross-piece (guard), grass from
the hair of its body, trees from the hair of its head, rain from its
tears, and dew from its sweat.</p>
<p class="par">Another account, also obtained from a local magician,
contains one or two additional details about the tree. &ldquo;<i lang=
"ms">Kun</i>,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;<i lang="ms">Payah<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1528src" href="#xd21e1528" name="xd21e1528src">8</a>
kun</i>&rdquo; said Muhammad, and a seed was created.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The seed became a root (lit. sinew), the root a
tree, and the tree brought forth leaves.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;<i lang="ms">Kun</i>,&rsquo; said God,
&lsquo;<i lang="ms">Payah kun</i>,&rsquo; said Muhammad; ... Then were
Heaven and Earth (created), &lsquo;Earth of the width of a tray, Heaven
of the width of an umbrella.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This is a curious passage, and one not over-easy to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>explain; such evidence as may be drawn from analogy
suggests, however, that the &ldquo;Earth of the width of a tray, and
Heaven of the width of an umbrella,&rdquo; may be intended to represent
respectively the &ldquo;souls&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">s&#277;mangat</i>)
of heaven and earth, in which case they would bear the same relation to
the material heaven and earth as the man-shaped human soul does to the
body of a man.</p>

the lake. This is inhabited by a vast crab, who goes forth at stated
periods during the day. When the creature returns to its abode the
displaced water causes the flow of the tide; when he departs, the water
rushing into the cavern causes the ebb.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Clifford gives a slightly different
explanation:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">Pusat tasek</i>, or Navel of the
Seas, supposed to be a huge hole in the ocean bottom. In this hole
there sits a gigantic crab which twice a day gets out in order to
search for food. While he is sitting in the hole the waters of the
ocean are unable to pour down into the under world, the whole of the
aperture being filled and blocked by the crab&rsquo;s bulk. The
inflowing of the rivers into the sea during these periods are supposed
to cause the rising of the tide, while the downpouring of the waters
through the great hole when the crab is absent searching for food is
supposed to cause the ebb.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Concerning the wonderful legendary tree (the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>Pauh Janggi) the following story was related to me
by a Selangor Malay:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There was once a Selangor man named Haji Batu, or
the Petrified Pilgrim, who got this name from the fact that the first
joints of all the fingers of one hand had been turned into stone. This
happened in the following manner. In the old days when men went
voyaging in sailing vessels, he determined to visit Mecca, and
accordingly set sail. After sailing for about two months they drifted
out of their course for some ten or fifteen days, and then came to a
part of the sea where there were floating trunks of trees, together
with rice-straw (<i lang="ms">batang padi</i>) and all manner of
flotsam. Yet again they drifted for seven days, and upon the seventh
night Haji Batu dreamed a dream. In this dream one who wore the
pilgrim&rsquo;s garb appeared to him, and warned him to carry on his
person a hammer and seven nails, and when he came to a tree which would
be the Pauh Janggi he was to drive the first of the nails into its stem
and cling thereto. Next day the ship reached the great whirlpool which
is called the Navel of the Seas,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1687src"
href="#xd21e1687" name="xd21e1687src">14</a> and while <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>the ship was
being sucked into the eddy close to the tree and engulfed, Haji Batu
managed to drive the first nail home, and clung to it as the ship went
down. After a brief interval he endeavoured to drive in the second
nail, somewhat higher up the stem than the first (why Haji Batu could
not climb without the aid of nails history does not relate), and
drawing himself up by it, drove in the third. Thus progressing, by the
time he had driven in all the seven nails he had reached the top of the
tree, when he discovered among the branches a nest of young rocs. Here
he rested, and having again been advised in a dream, he waited. On the
following day, when the parent roc had returned and was engaged in
feeding its young with an elephant which it had brought for the
purpose, he bound himself to its feathers with his girdle, and was
carried in this manner many hundreds of miles to the westward, where,
upon the roc&rsquo;s nearing the ground, he let himself go, and thus
dropping to the earth, fell into a swoon. On recovering consciousness
he walked on till he came to a house, where he asked for and obtained
some refreshment. On his departure he was advised to go westward, and
so proceeded for a long distance until he arrived at a beautifully
clear pool in an open plain, around which were to be seen many stone
figures of human beings. The appearance of these stone figures
rendering him suspicious, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>refrained from drinking the water,
and dipped into it merely the tips of his fingers, which became
immediately petrified. Proceeding he met a vast number of wild
animals&mdash;pigs, deer, and elephants&mdash;which were fleeing from
the pursuit of a beast of no great size indeed, but with fiery red fur.
He therefore prudently climbed into a tree to allow it to pass. The
beast, however, pursued him and commenced to climb the tree, but as it
climbed he drove the point of his poniard (<i lang="ms">badik</i>) into
its skull, and killed it. He then robbed it of its whiskers, and
thereafter, on his reaching a town, everybody fled from him because of
the whiskers which had belonged to so fierce a beast. The Raja of that
country, begging for one of them, and giving him food, he presented him
with one of the whiskers in payment. After paying his way in a similar
manner at seven successive villages, the Petrified Pilgrim at length
reached Mecca.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bores,&rdquo; or &ldquo;eagres,&rdquo; at the
mouths of rivers, and floods<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1735src" href=
"#xd21e1735" name="xd21e1735src">15</a> due to heavy rain, are
conceived to be caused by the passage of some gigantic animal, most
probably a sort of dragon, as in the case of landslips, which will be
mentioned later.</p>
<p class="par">This animal, whose passage up rivers is held to cause
the tidal wave or bore, is called B&#277;n&#259; in Selangor. It is a
matter of common report among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>Malays at Jugra, on the Selangor
coast, that a bore formerly &ldquo;frequented&rdquo; the Langat river,
near its mouth. This was anterior to the severance of the narrow neck
of land<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1755src" href="#xd21e1755" name=
"xd21e1755src">16</a> at Bandar that divided the old channel of the
Langat river from the stream into which the waters of the Langat now
flow, forming the short cut to the sea called the Jugra Passage. In the
days when the bore came up the river the Malays used to go out in small
canoes or dug-outs to &ldquo;sport amongst the breakers&rdquo;
(<i lang="ms">main g&#277;lombang</i>), frequently getting upset for
their pains. Eventually, however (I was told), the bore was killed by a
Langat Malay, who struck it upon the head with a stick! It is
considered that this must be true, since there is no bore in the Langat
river now!</p>
<p class="par">Eclipses (<i lang="ms">G&#277;rhana</i>) of the sun or

that if they make a sufficient din they will frighten the monster
away.</p>

eclipse from the Malay point of view:&mdash;</p>

brass gongs, in which the devils of the Chinese are supposed to take

Malay drums throb and beat and thud; all manner of shrill yells fill
the sky, and the roar of a thousand native voices rises heavenwards, or
rolls across the white waters of the river, which are flecked with deep
shadows and reflections. The jungles on the far bank take up the sound
and send it pealing back in recurring ringing echoes till the whole
world seems to shout in chorus. The Moon which bathes the earth in
splendour, the Moon which is so dear to each one of us, is in dire
peril this night, for that fierce monster, the <i lang=

striving to swallow her. You can mark his black bulk creeping over her,
dimming her face, consuming her utterly, while she suffers in the agony
of silence. How often in the past has she served us with the light; how
often has she made night more beautiful than day for our tired,
sun-dazed eyes to look upon; and shall she now perish without one
effort on our part to save her by scaring the Monster from his prey?
No! A thousand times no! So we shout, and clang the gongs, and beat the
drums, till all the animal world joins in the tumult, and even
inanimate nature lends its voice to swell the <span class=

with a thousand resonant echoes. At last the hated Monster reluctantly
retreats. Our war-cry has reached his ears, and he slinks sullenly
away, and the pure, sad, kindly Moon looks down in love and gratitude
upon us, her children, to whose aid she owes her
deliverance.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1819src" href=

been named from some forgotten legend in which a dragon played a part.
Dragons and mountains are generally connected in Malay ideas. The caves
in the limestone hill Gunong Pondok, in P&ecirc;rak, are said to be
haunted by a <i lang="la">genius loci</i> in the form of a snake who is
popularly called <i lang="ms">Si Bujang</i>. This seems to prove beyond

Pondok is sometimes as small as a viper, and sometimes as large as a

on the mountains, which are tolerably frequent during very heavy rains,
and which, being produced by the same cause, are often simultaneous
with the flooding of rivers and the destruction of property, are
attributed by the natives to the sudden breaking forth of dragons

called <i lang="ms">hulu Malayu</i> (the &ldquo;Malay hilt&rdquo;), or
<i lang="ms">Jawa d&#277;mam</i> (lit. the &ldquo;Fever-stricken

folded arms. The pattern of these hilts, which are universally used for
the national Malay <i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i> or dagger, varies from
an accurate representation of the human figure to forms in which
nothing but the hood (which is occasionally much exaggerated) is
recognisable. Europeans seeing these hilts for the first time sometimes
take them for snakes&rsquo; heads, sometimes for the heads of

of which Sir H. Yule, <i>s.v.</i> Coco-de-Mer, gives the following
interesting account:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;<i>Coco-de-Mer</i>, or <i>Double
Coco-nut</i>, the curious twin fruit so called, the produce of the
<i lang="la">Lodoicea Sechellarum</i>, a palm growing only in the
Seychelles Islands, is cast up on the shores of the Indian Ocean, most
frequently on the Maldive Islands, but occasionally also on Ceylon and
S. India, and on the coasts of Zanzibar, of Sumatra, and some others of
the Malay Islands. Great virtues as medicine and antidote were supposed
to reside in these fruits, and extravagant prices were paid for them.
The story goes that a &lsquo;country captain,&rsquo; expecting to make
his fortune, took a cargo of these nuts from the Seychelles Islands to
Calcutta, but the only result was to destroy their value for the
future.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The old belief was that the fruit was
produced on a palm growing below the sea, whose fronds, according to
Malay seamen, were sometimes seen in quiet bights on the Sumatran
coast, especially in the Lampong Bay. According to one form of the
story among the Malays, which is told both by Pigafetta and by
Rumphius, there was but one such tree, the fronds of which rose above
an abyss of the Southern Ocean, and were the abode of the monstrous
bird Garuda (or Rukh of the Arabs). The tree itself was called <i lang=
"ms">Pau-sengi</i>, which Rumphius seems to interpret as a corruption
of <i lang="ms">Buwa-zangi</i>, &lsquo;Fruit of Zang,&rsquo; or E.
Africa. They were cast up occasionally on the islands of the S.W. coast
of Sumatra; and the wild people of the islands brought them for sale to
the Sumatran marts, such as Padang and Priamang. One of the largest
(say about twelve inches across) would sell for 150 rix dollars. But
the Malay princes coveted them greatly, and would sometimes (it was
alleged) give a laden junk for a single nut. In India the best-known
source of supply was from the Maldive Islands.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The medical virtues of the nut were not
only famous among all the people of the East, including the Chinese,
but are extolled by Piso and by Rumphius, with many details. The
latter, learned and laborious student of nature as he was, believed in
the submarine origin of the nut, though he discredited its growing on a
great palm, as no traces of such a plant had ever been discovered on
the coasts. The fame of the nut&rsquo;s virtues had extended to Europe,
and the Emperor Rudolf II. in his latter days offered in vain 4000
florins to purchase from the family of Wolfert Hermanszen, a Dutch
Admiral, one which had been presented to that commander by the King of
Bantam, on the Hollander&rsquo;s relieving his capital, attacked by the
Portuguese in 1602.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Hobson-Jobson</i>, <i>loc.
cit.</i></p>
<p class="par footnote">To this valuable note I would add that Rumphius
is evidently wrong if he derives the name of the tree,
&ldquo;Pau-sengi,&rdquo; from the Malay &ldquo;Buwa-zangi.&rdquo; The
first part of the word is &ldquo;Pau&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pauh,&rdquo;
which is perfectly good Malay, and is the name given to various species
of mango, especially the wild one, so that &ldquo;Pau-sengi&rdquo;
actually represents (not &ldquo;Buwa,&rdquo; but) &ldquo;Pauh
Janggi,&rdquo; which is to this day the universal Malay name for the
tree which grows, according to Malay fable, in the central whirlpool or
Navel of the Seas. Some versions add that it grows upon a sunken bank
(<i lang="ms">t&#277;bing runtoh</i>), and is guarded by dragons. This
tree figures largely in Malay romances, especially those which form the
subject of Malay shadow-plays, (<i>vide infra</i>, Pl. 23, for an
illustration of the Pauh Janggi and the Crab). Rumphius&rsquo;
explanation of the second part of the name (<i>i.e.</i> Janggi) is, no
doubt, quite correct.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

fishes, and colossal dragons (<i lang="ms">naga umbang</i>), and the
magic dragons (<i lang="ms">naga sri naga ka-sak-tian</i>), assembled
together to eat and devour him, and such a tumult arose that the Raja
Naga, who was superior to all, heard it and came to see. Now when he
beheld the Golden Dragon he opened his jaws to their full extent, and
made three attempts to seize and swallow him, but failed each time. At
length, however, he caught him, and dashed him against the sea bottom
with such force that his head was buried in the ground, but the little
dragon cared not at all. Then the Raja Naga said: &lsquo;Tell me the
truth! from what land hast thou fallen (<i lang="ms">titek d&#277;ri
pada n&#277;gri ninggua mana</i>), and whose son and offspring art
thou?&rsquo; To which the Golden Dragon made answer, saying, &lsquo;I
have no land nor country, I have neither father nor mother, but I was
incarnated from the hollow part of a bamboo!&rsquo; When the Raja Naga
heard this he sent for his spectacles (<i lang="ms">ch&#277;rmin
mata</i>), and by their aid he was able to see the real parentage of
the Golden Dragon and all concerning him, and he at once told him
everything concerning his birth (<i lang="ms">usul asal
ka-jadi-an-nya</i>), and informed him that they were close relations,
since the Golden Dragon&rsquo;s mother was a relative of the Raja Naga.
Then the Raja Naga kissed and embraced his nephew, and congratulated
himself on having seen him before his time came to die, and calling
together all his people to feast, installed (<i lang="ms">tabal</i>)
the Golden Dragon as king over them in his own place, since he was very
old. Thus the Golden Dragon continued to live in increasing state and
prosperity at the <i lang="ms">Pusat tasek</i>, and was greatly beloved
by his uncle, the Raja Naga; and in the course of time his horn

<p class="par first">A common feature in Malay romances and legends is
a description of the supernatural development of a young child in the
interior of some vegetable production, usually a bamboo.</p>
<p class="par">Sir W. E. Maxwell has pointed out the fact of the
existence, both in Malay and Japanese legends, of the main features of
this story, to which he assigns a Buddhistic origin. He tells the story
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>The Raja of the Bamboo.</i>&mdash;Some years

as their principal incident the supernatural development of a prince,

<p class="par">&ldquo;Roorda van Eysinga&rsquo;s edition of the Sri

"xd21e2053src">3</a> Puspa Jaya Karma, to search for a suitable place
at which to found a settlement. The site having been found and cleared,
the narrative proceeds as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Now there was a clump of the <i lang=

fast as they cut down a branch on one side, a fresh one shot forth on
the other, to the great astonishment of all the Rajas, Mantris, and
warriors. Puspa Vikrama Jaya hastened back to King Dasaratha and laid
the matter before him. The latter was greatly surprised, and declared
that he would go himself the next day and see the bamboo cut down. Next
day he set out on a white elephant, attended by a splendid train of
chiefs and followers, and on reaching the spot ordered the bamboo clump
to be cut down. Vikrama Puspa Jaya pointed it out, shaded by the other
forest trees. The king perceived that it was of very elegant
appearance, and that an odour like spices and musk proceeded from it.
He told Puspa Jaya Vikrama to cut it down, and the latter drew his
sword, which was as big as the stem of a cocoa-nut tree, and with one
stroke cut down one of the bamboos. But immediately a fresh stem shot
forth on the other side, and this happened <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>as often
as a stroke was given. Then the king grew wroth, and getting down from
his elephant he drew his own sword and made a cut with it at the
bamboo, which severed a stem. Then, by the divine decree of the
Dewatas, the king became aware of a female form in the bamboo clump
seated on a highly ornamented platform (<i lang="ms">g&#277;ta</i>),
her face shining like the full moon when it is fourteen days old, and
the colour of her body being like gold of ten touch. On this, King
Dasaratha quickly unloosed his girdle and saluted the princess. Then he
lifted her on to his elephant and took her to his palace escorted by
music and singing.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2101src"

<p class="par">I myself have heard among the Selangor Malays similar
legends to the above, which, as already pointed out, are common in
Malay romances. A parallel myth is described in the following
words:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now, the Perak river overflows its banks once a
year, and sometimes there are very great floods. Soon after the
marriage of Nakhodah Kasim with the white Semang,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2116src" href="#xd21e2116" name="xd21e2116src">7</a> an
unprecedented flood occurred and quantities of foam came down the
river. Round the piles of the bathing-house, which, in accordance with
Malay custom, stood in the bed of the river close to the bank in front
of the house, the floating volumes of foam collected in a mass the size
of an elephant. Nakhodah Kasim&rsquo;s wife went to bathe, and finding
this island of froth in her way she attempted to move it away with a
stick; she removed the upper portion of it and disclosed a female
infant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>sitting in the midst of it enveloped all round
with cloud-like foam. The child showed no fear, and the white Semang,
carefully lifting her, carried her up to the house, heralding her
discovery by loud shouts to her husband. The couple adopted the child
willingly, for they had no children, and they treated her thenceforward
as their own. They assembled the villagers and gave them a feast,
solemnly announcing their adoption of the daughter of the river and
their intention of leaving to her everything that they possessed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The child was called Tan Puteh, but her father
gave her the name of Teh Purba.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2126src"
href="#xd21e2126" name="xd21e2126src">8</a> As she grew up the wealth

<p class="par">The usual story of the first creation of man, however,
appears to be a Malay modification of Arabic beliefs.</p>
<p class="par">Thus we are told that man was created from the four
elements&mdash;earth, air, water, and fire&mdash;in a way which the
following extract, taken from a Selangor charm-book, will
explain:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;God Almighty spake unto Gabriel, saying,</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;Be not disobedient, O Gabriel,</p>
<p class="line">But go and get me the Heart of the Earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">But he could not get the Heart of the Earth.</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;I will not give it,&rsquo; said the Earth.</p>
<p class="line">Then went the Prophet Israfel to get it,</p>
<p class="line">But he could not get the Heart of the Earth.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=

<p class="line">Then went Michael to get it,</p>
<p class="line">But he could not get the Heart of the Earth.</p>
<p class="line">Then went Azrael to get it,</p>
<p class="line">And at last he got the Heart of the Earth.</p>
<p class="line">When he got the Heart of the Earth</p>
<p class="line">The empyrean and crystalline spheres shook,</p>
<p class="line">And the whole Universe (shook).</p>
<p class="line">When he got the Heart of the Earth he<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2195src" href="#xd21e2195" name="xd21e2195src">10</a> made
from it the Image of Adam.</p>
<p class="line">But the Heart of the Earth was then too hard;</p>
<p class="line">He mixed Water with it, and it became too soft,</p>
<p class="line">(So) he mixed Fire with it, and at last struck out the
image of Adam.</p>
<p class="line">Then he raised up the image of Adam,</p>
<p class="line">And craved Life for it from Almighty God,</p>
<p class="line">And God Almighty gave it Life.</p>
<p class="line">Then sneezed God Almighty, and the image of Adam brake
in pieces,</p>
<p class="line">And he (Azrael) returned to remake the image of
Adam.</p>
<p class="line">Then God Almighty commanded to take steel of
Khorassan,</p>
<p class="line">And drive it down his back, so that it became the
thirty-three bones,</p>
<p class="line">The harder steel at the top, the softer below it.</p>
<p class="line">The harder steel shot up skywards,</p>
<p class="line">And the softer steel penetrated earthwards.</p>
<p class="line">Thus the image of Adam had life, and dwelt in
Paradise.</p>
<p class="line">(There) Adam beheld (two&nbsp;?) peacocks of no
ordinary beauty,</p>
<p class="line">And the Angel Gabriel appeared.</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;Verily, O Angel Gabriel, I am solitary,</p>
<p class="line">Easier is it to live in pairs, I crave a
wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">God Almighty spake, saying, &lsquo;Command Adam</p>
<p class="line">To pray at dawn a prayer of two
genuflexions.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">Then Adam prayed, and our Lady Eve descended,</p>
<p class="line">And was captured by the Prophet Adam;</p>
<p class="line">But before he had finished his prayer she was taken
back,</p>
<p class="line">Therefore Adam prayed the prayer of two genuflexions as
desired,</p>
<p class="line">And at the last obtained our Lady Eve.</p>
<p class="line">When they were married (Eve) bore twins every time,</p>
<p class="line">Until she had borne forty-four children,</p>
<p class="line">And the children, too, were wedded, handsome with
handsome, and plain with plain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The magician who dictated the above account stated
that when Azrael stretched forth his hand to take the Heart of the
Earth, the Earth-spirit caught hold of his middle finger, which yielded
to the strain, and thus became longer than the rest, and received its
Malay name of the &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Finger&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">jari
hantu</i>). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A parallel account adds that the Heart of the Earth was
white, and gives a fuller description of the interview between Azrael
and his formidable antagonist, the Earth. After saluting the latter in
the orthodox Muhammadan fashion, Azrael explains his mission, and is
met by a point-blank refusal. &ldquo;I will not give it,&rdquo; said
the Earth (referring to its Heart), &ldquo;forasmuch as I was so
created by God Almighty, and if you take away my Heart I shall
assuredly die.&rdquo; At this brusque, though perhaps natural retort,
the archangel loses his temper, and rudely exclaims that he &ldquo;will
take the Earth&rsquo;s Heart whether it will or no.&rdquo; Here Azrael
&ldquo;gave the Earth a push with his right hand and his left, and
grasping at the Heart of the Earth, got hold of it and carried it back
to the presence of God.&rdquo; God now summons Gabriel and orders him
to mould (lit. forge) the image of Adam. Then Gabriel took the lump of
earth which was the Earth&rsquo;s Heart and mixed it first with water
to soften it, then, as it was too soft, with fire to harden it, and
when the image was made, obtained life from God to put into
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2264src" href="#xd21e2264" name=

omitted]. Finally, the creation of &ldquo;our Lady&rdquo; Eve and the
birth of her first-born are described, the latter occasion being
accompanied by a thick darkness, which compelled Adam to take off his
turban and beat the child therewith in order to dispel the evil
influences (<i lang="ms">badi</i>) which had attended its
birth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2281src" href="#xd21e2281" name=

<p class="par">The following extract (from a Malay treatise quoted by
Newbold) fairly describes the general state of Malay ideas respecting
the constitution of the human body:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Plato, Socrates, Galen, Aristotle, and other
philosophers affirm that God created man of a fixed number of bones,
blood-vessels, etc. For instance, the skull is composed of 5&frac12;
bones, the place of smell and sense of 7 bones, between this and the
neck are 32 bones. The neck is composed of 7 bones, and the back of 24
bones; 208 bones are contained in the other members of the body. In all
there are 360 bones and 360 blood-vessels in a man&rsquo;s body. The
brains weigh 306 <i>miscals</i>, the blood 573. The total of all the
bones, blood-vessels, large and small, and gristles, amounts to 1093;
and the hairs of the head to six <i>lacs</i> and 4000. The frame of man
is divided into 40 great parts, which are again <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>subdivided. Four elements enter into his
composition, viz. air, fire, earth, and water. With these elements are
connected four essences&mdash;the soul or spirit with air, love with
fire, concupiscence with earth, and wisdom with water.&rdquo;<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In dealing with this branch of the subject I will
first take the case of the kings and priestly magicians who present the
most clearly-marked examples of personal sanctity which are now to be
found among Malays, and will then describe the chief features of the
sanctity ascribed to all ranks alike in respect of certain special
parts of the ordinary human anatomy. The theory of the king as the
Divine Man is held perhaps as strongly in the Malay region as in any
other part of the world, a fact which is strikingly emphasised by the
alleged right of Malay monarchs &ldquo;<i>to slay at pleasure, without
being guilty of a crime</i>.&rdquo; Not only is the king&rsquo;s person
considered sacred, but the sanctity of his body is believed to
communicate itself to his regalia, and to slay those who break the
royal taboos. Thus it is firmly believed that any one who seriously
offends the royal person, who touches (even for a moment) or who
imitates (even with the king&rsquo;s permission) the chief objects of
the regalia,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2329src" href="#xd21e2329"
name="xd21e2329src">14</a> or who wrongfully makes use <span class=

of the insignia or privileges of royalty, will be <i lang=
"ms">k&#277;na daulat</i>, <i>i.e.</i> struck dead, by a quasi-electric
discharge of that Divine Power which the Malays suppose to reside in
the king&rsquo;s person,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2346src" href=
"#xd21e2346" name="xd21e2346src">15</a> and which is called
&ldquo;Daulat&rdquo; or &ldquo;Royal Sanctity.&rdquo; Before I proceed,
however, to discuss this power, it will be best to give some
description of the regalia in which it resides:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Of Malacca Newbold says: &ldquo;The articles of Malay
regalia usually consist of a <i lang="ms">silasila</i>, or book of
genealogical descent, a code of laws, a vest or <i lang="ms">baju</i>,
and a few weapons, generally a <i lang="ms">kris</i>, <i lang=
"ms">kleywang</i>, or spear.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2369src"

<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">limbing</i> is a sort of lance;
the <i lang="ms">tombak bandrang</i> a spear of state, four or seven of
which are usually carried before the chiefs in the interior of the

a horse-tail, dyed crimson, sometimes crimson and white; this is
generally of hair.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2381src" href=

commanded by his mistress to open negotiations with Johor, and this
having been done, a prince of the royal house of that kingdom, who
traced his descent from the old line of Menangkabau, sailed for Perak
to assume the sovereignty. He brought with him the insignia of royalty,
namely, the royal drums (<i lang="ms">gandang nobat</i>), the pipes

forth the sounds of twelve instruments, the second time it played as if

<p class="par">But the extraordinary strength of the Malay belief in
the supernatural powers of the regalia of their sovereigns can only be
thoroughly realised after a study of their romances, in which their
kings are credited with all the attributes of inferior gods, whose
birth, as indeed every subsequent act of their after life, is attended
by the most amazing prodigies.</p>
<p class="par">They are usually invulnerable, and are gifted with
miraculous powers, such as that of transforming themselves, and of
returning to (or recalling others to) life; in fact they have, in every
way, less of the man about them and more of the god. Thus it is that
the following description of the dress of an old-time Raja falls easily
into line with what would otherwise appear the objectless jargon which
still constitutes the preamble of many a Malay prince&rsquo;s letters,
but which can yet be hardly regarded as mere rhetoric, since it has a
deep meaning for those who read it:&mdash;</p>

larger ones followed the seams.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then his waistband (<i lang="ms">kain ikat pinggang</i>)

<p class="par">&ldquo;Sultan Muhammed Shah again established in order
the throne of his sovereignty. He was the first who prohibited the
wearing of yellow clothes in public, not even a handkerchief of that
colour, nor curtains, nor hangings, nor large pillow-cases, nor
coverlets, nor any envelope of any bundle, nor the cloth lining of a
house, excepting only the waist cloth, the coat, and the turban. He
also prohibited the constructing of houses with abutments, or smaller
houses connected with them; also suspended pillars or timbers (<i lang=

the roofs, and also summer houses.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3045src"
href="#xd21e3045" name="xd21e3045src">34</a> He also prohibited the
ornamenting of creeses with gold, and the wearing anklets of gold, and
the wearing the <i lang="ms">koronchong</i>, or hollow bracelets
(anklets?) of gold, ornamented with silver. None of these prohibited
articles did he permit to be worn by a person, however rich he might
be, unless by his particular licence, a privilege which the raja has
ever since possessed. He also forbade any one to enter the palace
unless wearing a cloth petticoat<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3057src"

person was permitted to enter unless in this array, and if any one wore
his <i>creese</i> behind him, it was incumbent on the porter of the
gate to seize it. Such is the order of former time respecting
prohibition by the Malayu rajas, and whatever is contrary to this is a
transgression against the raja, and ought to incur a fine of five
<i>cati</i>. The white <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34"

one, because it is seen conspicuous at a greater distance, was also

<p class="par">A number of other particulars bearing on this subject
will be found in other parts of the text, and in the Appendix
references are given to other works for additional details, which are
too numerous to be recorded here.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At funerals, whether the deceased has been a
great or insignificant person, if he be a subject, the use of the
Payong (umbrella) and the <i lang="ms">Puwadi</i> is interdicted, as
also the distribution of alms, unless by royal permission; otherwise
the articles thus forbidden will be confiscated.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i lang=

<p class="par">A distinction is also now drawn between manufactured
yellow cloth and cloth which has been dyed yellow with saffron, the
wrongful use of the latter (the genuine article) being regarded as the

<p class="par">In addition to the royal monopoly of such objects
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=

three royal perquisites (<i lang="ms">larangan raja</i>), <i>i.e.</i>

He adds, &ldquo;It used to be a capital offence to give false
information to the Raja about any of these. The &lsquo;<i lang=
"ms">k&#277;tiar</i>&rsquo; tree is said to affect certain localities,
and is found in groves not mixed with other trees. In former days, when
the fruit was ripe, the whole of the Raja&rsquo;s household would turn
out to gather it. It is said to yield a very large percentage of
oil.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3157src" href="#xd21e3157" name=

name="xd21e3192src">43</a></p>
<p class="par">Besides the above there are not a few linguistic taboos
connected with the king&rsquo;s person, such as the use of the words
<i lang="ms">santap</i>, to eat; <i lang="ms">b&#277;radu</i>, to
sleep; <i lang="ms">b&#277;rs&#277;maiam</i>, to be seated, or to

substituted for the ordinary Malay words when reference is made to the
king.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3222src" href="#xd21e3222" name=
"xd21e3222src">44</a> Moreover, when the king dies his name is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>dropped, and he receives the title of
&ldquo;Marhum,&rdquo; the late or &ldquo;deceased,&rdquo; with the
addition of an expression alluding to some prominent fact in his life,
or occasionally to the place of his decease. These titles, strange as
it may seem, are often the reverse of complimentary, and occasionally
ridiculous.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3267src" href="#xd21e3267" name=
"xd21e3267src">45</a></p>
<p class="par">It must not be forgotten, too, in discussing the divine
attributes of the Malay king, that he is firmly believed to possess a
personal influence over the works of nature, such as the growth of the
crops and the bearing of fruit-trees. This same property is supposed to
reside in a lesser degree in his delegates, and even in the persons of
Europeans in charge of districts. Thus I have frequently known (in
Selangor) the success or failure of the rice crops attributed to a
change of district officers, and in one case I even heard an outbreak
of ferocity which occurred among man-eating crocodiles laid at the door
of a most zealous and able, though perhaps occasionally somewhat
unsympathetic, representative of the Government. So, too, on one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>occasion when three deaths occurred during a
District Officer&rsquo;s temporary absence, the mere fact of his
absence was considered significant. I may add that royal blood is
supposed by many Malays to be white, and this is the pivot on which the
plot of not a few Malay folk-tales is made to turn.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3288src" href="#xd21e3288" name="xd21e3288src">46</a></p>
<p class="par">Finally, it must be pointed out that the greatest
possible importance is attached to the method of saluting the king.</p>
<p class="par">In the &ldquo;Sri Rama&rdquo; (the Malay Ramayana) we
read, even of the <i>chiefs</i>, that&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;While yet some way off they bowed to the

<p class="par first">Equals in rank when saluting one another

"xd21e3338src">49</a> (though they do not shake) each other&rsquo;s
hands, but a person of humble birth must not touch hands in saluting a
great chief. &ldquo;A man, named Imam Bakar, was once slain at Pasir
Tambang, at the mouth of the T&#277;mb&#277;ling river. He incautiously
touched hands in greeting with a Chief called To&rsquo; Gajah, and the
latter, seizing him in an iron grip, held him fast, while he was
stabbed to death with spears.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3344src" href="#xd21e3344" name="xd21e3344src">50</a></p>
<p class="par">In saluting a great Chief, like the Dato&rsquo; Maharaja
P&#277;rba J&#277;lai, the hands are &ldquo;lifted up in salutation
with the palms pressed together, as in the attitude of Christian
prayer, but the tips of the thumbs are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>not suffered to ascend
beyond the base of the chin. In saluting a real R&acirc;ja, the hands
are carried higher and higher, according to the prince&rsquo;s rank,
until, for the Sult&acirc;n, the tips of the thumbs are on a level with
the forehead. Little details such as these are of immense importance in
the eyes of the Malays, and not without reason, seeing that in an
Independent Native State many a man has come by his death for
carelessness in their observance.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3354src" href="#xd21e3354" name="xd21e3354src">51</a></p>
<p class="par">In the king&rsquo;s audience hall the formal salutations
are performed in a sitting posture, and in this case, too, the greatest
attention is paid to the height to which the hands are raised. The
chief twice makes salutation in a sitting posture as he advances, and
at the third advance bends over the Sultan&rsquo;s hands, two more
salutations being made on his way back to his place.</p>
<p class="par">A flagrant infringement of any of the prerogatives of
the Sultan, such as those I have described, is certain, it is thought,
to prove fatal, more or less immediately.</p>
<p class="par">Thus the death of P&#277;nghulu Mohit, a well-known
Malay headman of the Klang district, in Selangor, which took place
while I was in charge of that district, was at the time very generally
attributed by the local Malays to his usurpation of certain royal
privileges or prerogatives on the occasion of his daughter&rsquo;s
wedding. One of these was his acceptance of gift-buffaloes,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>decorated after the royal fashion, which were
presented to him as wedding gifts in his daughter&rsquo;s honour. These
buffaloes had a covering of cloth put over them, their horns covered,
and a crescent-shaped breast-ornament (<i lang="ms">dokoh</i>) hung
about their necks. Thus dressed they were taken to Mohit&rsquo;s house
in solemn procession.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3375src" href=
"#xd21e3375" name="xd21e3375src">52</a> It was, at the time, considered
significant that the very first of these gift-buffaloes, which had been
brought overland from Jugra, where the Sultan lived, had died on
arrival, and whatever the cause may have been, it is a fact that
Mohit&rsquo;s mother died a day or two after the conclusion of the
wedding ceremonies, and that Mohit himself was taken ill almost
immediately and died only about a fortnight later.</p>
<p class="par">The only person who, in former days, was not in the
least affected by the royal taboos which protected the regalia from the
common touch was the (now I believe extinct) official who held the post
of Court Physician (Maharaja Lela). He, and he alone, might go freely
in the royal apartments wherever he chose, and the immunity and freedom
which he enjoyed in this respect passed into a proverb, the expression
&ldquo;to act the Court Physician&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">buat Maharaja
Lela</i>) being used to describe an altogether unwarrantable
familiarity or impertinence.</p>
<p class="par">The following story (though I tell it against myself) is
perhaps the best illustration I can give of the great danger supposed
to be incurred by those who meddle with the paraphernalia of royalty.
Among the late Sultan&rsquo;s insignia of royalty (in 1897) were a
couple of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>drums (<i lang="ms">g&#277;ndang</i>) and the long
silver trumpet which I have already described. Such trumpets are found
among the <i lang="ms">kab&#277;saran</i> or regalia of most Malay
States, and are always, I believe, called <i lang="ms">l&#277;mpiri</i>
or <i lang="ms">n&#277;mpiri</i> (Pers. <i lang="ms">nafiri</i>). They
are considered so sacred that they can only be handled or sounded, it
is believed, by a tribe of Malays called &ldquo;Orang Kalau,&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;Kalau men,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3403src" href=
"#xd21e3403" name="xd21e3403src">53</a> as any one else who attempted
to sound them would be struck dead. Even the &ldquo;Orang Kalau,&rdquo;
moreover, can only sound this instrument at the proper time and season
(<i>e.g.</i> at the proclamation of a new sovereign), for if they were
to sound it at any other time its noise would slay all who heard it,
since it is the chosen habitation of the &ldquo;Jin
Karaja&rsquo;an&rdquo; or State Demon,<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This trumpet and the drums of the Selangor regalia were
kept by the present Sultan (then Raja Muda, or Crown Prince of
Selangor) in a small galvanised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>iron cupboard which stood (upon
posts about three feet high) in the middle of a lawn outside His
Highness&rsquo; &ldquo;garden residence&rdquo; at Bandar. His Highness
himself informed me that they had once been kept in the house itself,
but when there they were the source of infinite annoyance and anxiety
to the inmates on account of their very uncanny behaviour!</p>
<p class="par">Drops of perspiration, for instance, would form upon the
Trumpet when a leading member of the Royal House was about to die (this
actually happened, as I was told, at Langat just before the death of
Tungku &rsquo;Chik, the late Sultan&rsquo;s eldest daughter, who died
during my residence in the neighbourhood). Then one Raja Bakar, son of
a Raja &#703;Ali, during the rethatching of the house at Bandar,
accidentally trod upon the wooden barrel of one of the State
Drums&mdash;and <i>died in consequence of his inadvertence</i>. When,
therefore, a hornet&rsquo;s nest formed inside one of these same drums
it was pretty clear that things were going from bad to worse, and a
<i>Chinaman</i> was ordered to remove it, no Malay having been found
willing to risk his life in undertaking so dangerous an office&mdash;an
unwillingness which was presently justified, as the Chinaman, too,
after a few days&rsquo; interval, <i>swelled up and died</i>. Both
these strange coincidences were readily confirmed by the present Sultan
on an occasion when I happened to question the authenticity of the
story, and as His Highness is one of the most enlightened and truthful
of men, such confirmation cannot easily be set aside. But the strangest
coincidence of all was to follow, for not long afterwards, having never
seen that portion of the regalia which was in the Raja Muda&rsquo;s
charge, I happened to mention to a Malay friend of mine at Jugra my
wish to be allowed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>examine these objects, and was at once begged
not to touch them, on the ground that &ldquo;no one could say what
might follow.&rdquo; But shortly after, having occasion to visit the
Raja Muda at his house at Bandar, I took the opportunity of asking
whether there was any objection to my seeing these much debated
objects, and as His Highness not only very obligingly assented, but
offered to show them to me himself, I was able both to see and to
handle them, His Highness himself taking the Trumpet out of its yellow
case and handing it to me. I thought nothing more of the matter at the
time, but, by what was really a very curious coincidence, within a few
days&rsquo; time of the occurrence, was seized with a sharp attack of
malarial influenza, the result of which was that I was obliged to leave
the district, and go into hospital at headquarters. In a Malay village
news spreads quickly, and the report of my indisposition, after what
was no doubt regarded as an act of extraordinary rashness, appears to
have made a profound impression, and the result of it was that a Malay
who probably considered himself indebted to me for some assistance he
had received, bound himself by a vow to offer sacrifice at the shrine
of a famous local saint should I be permitted to return to the
district. Of this, however, I knew nothing at the time, and nothing
could have exceeded my astonishment when I found upon my return that it
was my duty to attend the banquet which took place at the saint&rsquo;s
tomb in honour of my own recovery!<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3505src"
href="#xd21e3505" name="xd21e3505src">56</a></p>
<p class="par">Having shown the wide gulf which divides the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>&ldquo;divine man&rdquo; from his fellows, I have
still to point out the extent to which certain portions of the human
frame have come to be invested with sanctity, and to require to be
treated with special ceremonies. These parts of the anatomy are, in
particular, the head, the hair, the teeth, the ears, and the nails, all
of which I will take in their order.</p>
<p class="par">The head, in the first place, is undoubtedly still
considered by the Malays to possess some modified degree of sanctity. A
proof of this is the custom (<i lang="ms">&#703;adat</i>) which
regulates the extent of the sacrifice to be offered in a case of
assault or battery by the party committing the injury. If any part of
the head is injured, nothing less than a goat will suffice (the animal
being killed and both parties bathed in the blood); if the upper part
of the body, the slaughter of a cock (to be disposed of in a similar
way) will be held to be sufficient reparation, and so on, the sacrifice
becoming of less value in proportion as the injured part is farther
from the head. So, too, Mr. Frazer writes: &ldquo;The ... superstition
(of the sanctity of the head) exists among the Malays; for an early
traveller reports that in Java people &lsquo;wear nothing on their
heads, and say that nothing must be on their heads, ... and if any
person were to put his hand upon their head they would kill him; and
they do not build houses with stories in order that they may not walk
over each other&rsquo;s heads.&rsquo; It is also found in full force
throughout Polynesia.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3519src" href=
"#xd21e3519" name="xd21e3519src">57</a></p>
<p class="par">From the principle of the sanctity of the head flows, no
doubt, the necessity of using the greatest circumspection <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>during
the process of cutting the hair.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3529src"
href="#xd21e3529" name="xd21e3529src">58</a> Sometimes throughout the
whole life of the wearer, and frequently during special periods, the
hair is left uncut. Thus I was told that in former days Malay men
usually wore their hair long, and I myself have seen an instance of
this at Jugra in Selangor in the person of a Malay<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3541src" href="#xd21e3541" name="xd21e3541src">59</a> of the
old school, who was locally famous on this account. So, too, during the
forty days which must elapse before the purification of a woman after
the birth of her child, the father of the child is forbidden to cut his
hair, and a similar abstention is said to have been formerly incumbent
upon all persons either prosecuting a journey or engaging in war. Often
a boy&rsquo;s head is entirely shaven shortly after birth with the
exception of a single lock in the centre of the head, and so maintained
until the boy begins to grow up, but frequently the operation is
postponed (generally, it is said, in consequence of a vow made by the
child&rsquo;s parents) until the period of puberty or marriage. Great
care, too, must be exercised in disposing of the clippings of hair
(more especially the <i>first</i> clippings), as the Malay profoundly
believes that &ldquo;the sympathetic connection which exists between
himself and every part <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45"
name="pb45">45</a>]</span>of his body continues to exist even after the
physical connection has been severed, and that therefore he will suffer
from any harm that may befall the severed parts of his body, such as
the clippings of his hair or the parings of his nails. Accordingly he
takes care that those severed portions of himself shall not be left in
places where they might either be exposed to accidental injury, or fall
into the hands of malicious persons who might work magic on them to his
detriment or death.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3575src" href=
"#xd21e3575" name="xd21e3575src">60</a></p>
<p class="par">Thus we invariably find clippings of the victim&rsquo;s
hair mentioned (together with parings of his nails, etc.) as forming
part of the ingredients of the well-known wax image or mannikin into
which pins are stuck, and which is still believed by all Malays to be a
most effective method of causing the illness or death of an
enemy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3583src" href="#xd21e3583" name=
"xd21e3583src">61</a> I was once present at the curious ceremony of
cutting the hair of a Malay bride, which had all the characteristics of
a religious rite, but the detailed account of it will be reserved for a
later chapter.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3591src" href="#xd21e3591"
name="xd21e3591src">62</a></p>
<p class="par">The same difficulties and dangers which beset the first
cutting of the hair apply, though perhaps in a less degree, to the
first paring of the nails (<i lang="ms">b&#277;rtobak</i>), the boring
of the ears of girls (<i lang="ms">b&#277;rtindek t&#277;linga</i>),
and the filing of the teeth (<i lang="ms">b&#277;rasah gigi</i>) of
either sex whether at puberty or marriage. One or more of the nails are
frequently worn long by Malays of standing, and the women who engage in
&ldquo;nautch&rdquo; dancing and theatrical performances invariably
wear a complete set of artificial nails (<i lang="ms">changgei</i>).
These latter are usually of brass, are often several inches in length,
and are made so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>as to fit on to the tips of the fingers.
Occasionally a brass ring with a small peacock, or some such bird, of
the same material will be attached to the end of the nail by a minute
brass chain. The practice of wearing long nails is sometimes attributed
to Chinese influence, but it is hard to see why this particular detail
of Malay custom, which is quite in keeping with the general trend of
Malay ideas about the person, should be supposed to be derived from
China. The borrowing, if any, is much more likely to have been on the
part of the Chinese, who undoubtedly imported many Indian ideas along
with Buddhism. The custom appears to be followed, moreover, in many
places, such as the interior of Sumatra, where Chinese influence is
non-existent. In Siam, again, it appears to obtain very
strongly;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3614src" href="#xd21e3614" name=
"xd21e3614src">63</a> but no reason has yet been shown for supposing
that this is anything but an instance of the similarity of results
independently arrived at by nations starting with similar
premisses.</p>
<p class="par">The ear-boring and tooth-filing ceremonies which still
not infrequently take place at the age of puberty in both sexes are of
no less religious import than the rite of cutting the first lock. The
main details of these ceremonies will be described in a later part of
this book.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3628src" href="#xd21e3628" name=
"xd21e3628src">64</a></p>
<p class="par">To the same category (of sacred things having physical
connection with the body) should doubtless be referred such objects as
the eyebrows, the saliva, and soil taken from the (naked) footstep, all
of which are utilised by the magician to achieve his nefarious ends.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Malay conception of the Human Soul (<i lang=
"ms">S&#277;mangat</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3651src" href=
"#xd21e3651" name="xd21e3651src">65</a> is that of a species of
&ldquo;Thumbling,&rdquo; &ldquo;a thin, unsubstantial human
image,&rdquo; or mannikin, which is temporarily absent from the body in
sleep, trance, disease, and permanently absent after death.</p>
<p class="par">This mannikin, which is usually invisible but is
supposed to be about as big as the thumb, corresponds exactly in shape,
proportion, and even in complexion, to its embodiment or casing
(<i lang="ms">sarong</i>), <i>i.e.</i> the body in which it has its
residence. It is of a &ldquo;vapoury, shadowy, or filmy&rdquo; essence,
though not so impalpable but that it may cause displacement on entering
a physical object, and as it can &ldquo;fly&rdquo; or
&ldquo;flash&rdquo; quickly from place to place, it is often, perhaps
metaphorically, addressed as if it were a bird.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3674src" href="#xd21e3674" name="xd21e3674src">66</a></p>
<p class="par">Thus in a charm given in the Appendix we find&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="par first">As this mannikin is the exact reproduction in
every way of its bodily counterpart, and is &ldquo;the cause of life
and thought in the individual it animates,&rdquo; it may readily be
endowed with quasi-human feelings, and &ldquo;independently possess the
personal consciousness and volition of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>its corporeal
owner.&rdquo; Thus we find the following appeal addressed to the soul
in the charm just quoted:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Do not bear grudges,</p>
<p class="line">Do not bear malice,</p>
<p class="line">Do not take it as a wrong,</p>
<p class="line">Do not take it as a transgression.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">These quasi-human attributes of the soul being so
complete, it is an easy stretch of the imagination to provide it with a
house, which is generally in practice identified with the body of its
owner, but may also be identified with any one of its temporary
domiciles. Thus in the charm already quoted we read&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Return to your own House and House-ladder,</p>
<p class="line">To your own House-floor, of which the planks have
started,</p>
<p class="line">And your Roof-thatch &lsquo;starred&rsquo; with
holes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The state of disrepair into which the soul&rsquo;s
house (<i>i.e.</i> the sick man&rsquo;s body) is described as having
fallen, is here attributed to the soul&rsquo;s absence.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3734src" href="#xd21e3734" name=
"xd21e3734src">68</a> The completeness of this figurative
identification of the soul&rsquo;s &ldquo;house&rdquo; with its
owner&rsquo;s body, and of the soul&rsquo;s &ldquo;sheath&rdquo; or
casing with both, is very clearly brought out in the following
lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Cluck! cluck! Soul of this sick man,

Clearing and Yard,</p>
<p class="line">To your own Parents, to your own Casing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">And this is no mere chance expression, for in
another charm the soul is adjured in these words:&mdash; <span class=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;As you remember your own parents, remember

<p class="par first">The soul &ldquo;appears to men (both waking and

<p class="par first">It would probably be wrong to assume the foregoing
expressions to have always been merely figurative. Rather, perhaps, we
should consider them as part of a singularly complete and consistent
animistic system formerly invented and still held by the Malays. Again,
from the above ideas it follows that if you call a soul in the right
way it will hear and obey you, and you will thus be able either to
recall to its owner&rsquo;s body a soul which is escaping (<i lang=
"ms">riang s&#277;mangat</i>), or to abduct the soul of a person whom
you may wish to get into your power (<i lang="ms">m&#277;ngambil
s&#277;mangat orang</i>), and induce it to take up its residence in a
specially prepared receptacle, such as (<i>a</i>) a lump of earth which
has been sympathetically connected by direct contact with the body of
the soul&rsquo;s owner, or (<i>b</i>) a wax mannikin so connected by
indirect means, or even (<i>c</i>) a cloth which has had no such
connection whatever. And when you have succeeded in getting it into
your power the abducted and now imprisoned soul will naturally enjoy
any latitude <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=

temporary domicile or embodiment.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3806src"

<p class="par">Every man is supposed (it would appear from Malay
charms) to possess seven souls<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3814src"

should more accurately say, a sevenfold soul.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3820src" href="#xd21e3820" name="xd21e3820src">73</a> This
&ldquo;septenity in unity&rdquo; may perhaps be held to explain the
remarkable importance and persistency of the number seven in Malay
magic, as for instance the seven twigs of the birch, and the seven
repetitions of the charm (in Soul-abduction<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3826src" href="#xd21e3826" name="xd21e3826src">74</a>), the seven
betel leaves, the seven nights&rsquo; duration of the ceremony, the
seven blows administered to the soul (in other magical and medical
ceremonies), and the seven ears cut for the Rice-soul in
reaping.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3831src" href="#xd21e3831" name=

<p class="par">And, finally, it might explain why the lime-branch which
is hung up in the mosquito-curtain (in another form of
soul-abduction<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3838src" href="#xd21e3838"
name="xd21e3838src">76</a>) is required to possess seven fruits on a
single stalk, <i>i.e.</i> to ensure there being a separate receptacle
for each one of the seven souls.</p>
<p class="par">At the present day the ordinary Malay talks usually of
only a single soul, although he still keeps up the old phraseology in
his charms and charm-books. For the rest, it would appear that there
may be some method in the selection and arrangement of colours.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;lump of earth from the victim&rsquo;s
footprint&rdquo; used in one form of the soul-abduction
ceremony<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3850src" href="#xd21e3850" name=
"xd21e3850src">77</a> is to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href=
"#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>be wrapped up in three thicknesses of
cloth, which must be red, black, and yellow respectively, the yellow
being outside. Again (in the ceremony of casting out &ldquo;the
mischief&rdquo; from a sick man), a white cosmetic is assigned for use
in the morning, a red cosmetic for mid-day, and black for
sundown.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3857src" href="#xd21e3857" name=
"xd21e3857src">78</a></p>
<p class="par">Now in all, I believe, of what are now called the
Federated Malay States, and probably in all Malay States whatsoever,
yellow is the colour used by royalty, whereas the more exalted and
sacred colour, white (with occasional lapses into yellow), has been
adopted by Malay medicine-men as the colour most likely to conciliate
the spirits and demons with whom they have to deal. Thus the
soul-cloth, which, by the way, is always five cubits long (<i lang=
"ms">lima hasta</i>), is sometimes white and (much more rarely) yellow,
and hence in the first instance just quoted, the yellow cloth, being,
next to white, of the colour which is most complimentary to the demons,
is the one which is put outside; and in the second instance, for
similar reasons, the white cosmetic is to be used first.</p>
<p class="par">The working out of this system, however, must await
fresh evidence, and all I would do now is to emphasise the importance
of colour in such investigations, and to urge the collection of fresh
material.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3869src" href="#xd21e3869" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Hitherto I have treated of human souls only, but
animal, mineral, and vegetable souls will now be briefly discussed.
Speaking generally, I believe the soul to be, within certain limits,
conceived as a diminutive but exact counterpart of its own embodiment,
so that an Animal-soul would be like an animal, a Bird-soul like a
bird; however, lower in the scale of creation it would appear that the
Tree- or Ore-souls, for instance, are supposed, occasionally at least,
to assume the shape of some animal or bird. Thus the soul of Eagle-wood
is thought to take the shape of a bird, the soul of Tin-ore that of a
buffalo, the Gold-soul that of a deer.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3981src" href="#xd21e3981" name="xd21e3981src">80</a> It has,
however, always been recognised that the soul may enter other bodies
besides its own, or even bodies of a different kind to its own, and
hence these may be only apparent exceptions to the rule that the soul
should be the counterpart of its own embodiment.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3986src" href="#xd21e3986" name="xd21e3986src">81</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Among races within the limits of savagery, the
general doctrine of souls is found worked out with remarkable breadth
and consistency. The souls of animals are recognised by a natural
extension from the theory of human souls; the souls of trees and plants
follow in some vague, partial way, and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>souls of
inanimate objects expand the general category to its extremest
boundary.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3996src" href="#xd21e3996"

<p class="par">To the Malay who has arrived at the idea of a generally
animated Nature, but has not yet learned to draw scientific
distinctions, there appears nothing remarkable or unnatural in the idea
of vegetation-souls, or even in that of mineral-souls&mdash;rather
would he consider us Europeans illogical and inconsistent were he told
that we allowed the possession of souls to one half of the creation and
denied it to the other.</p>
<p class="par">Realising this, we are prepared to find that the Malay
theory of Animism embraces, at least partially, the human
race,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4009src" href="#xd21e4009" name=

food, clothes, ornaments, and other objects, which to us are not merely
soulless, but lifeless,&rdquo; brings us face to face with a conception
with which &ldquo;we are less likely to sympathise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Side by side with this general conception of an
universally animate nature, we find abundant evidences of a special
theory of Human Origin which is held to account not only for the larger
mammals, but also for the existence of a large number of birds, and
even for that of a few reptiles, fishes, trees and plants, but seems to
lose its operative force in proportion to its descent in the scale of
creation, until in the lowest scale of all, the theory of Human Origin
disappears <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>from sight, and nothing remains but the partial
application of a few vague anthropomorphic attributes.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4044src" href="#xd21e4044" name=
"xd21e4044src">89</a> It is, doubtless, to the prevalence of this
theory that we owe the extraordinary persistence of anthropomorphic
ideas about animals, birds, reptiles, trees, if not of minerals, in
Malay magical ceremonies;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4047src" href=
"#xd21e4047" name="xd21e4047src">90</a> and it is hard to say which of
these two notions&mdash;the theory of Human Origin, or the other theory
of Universal Animism&mdash;is to be considered the original form of
Malay belief.</p>
<p class="par">The following tale, which is entitled <i lang=

will serve as an illustration of the idea of Human Origin:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There was a married Sakai couple living at Ulu
Klang, and they had a son called M&#277;gat Sajobang. When he grew up
he said to his mother, &lsquo;Mother, get me a passage, I want to go
and see other countries.&rsquo; She did so, and he left Ulu Klang; and
ten or twelve years later, when he had grown rich enough to buy a
splendid ship (<i lang="ms">p&rsquo;rahu</i>), he returned with his
wife, who was with child, and seven midwives, who were watched over by
one of his body-guard with a drawn sword. His mother heard the news of
his return, and she made ready, roasting a <i lang="ms">chika</i>
(monkey) and <i lang="ms">lotong</i> (monkey), and went with his father
on board their bark canoe to meet their son.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As they approached they hailed him by his name;
but he was ashamed of their humble appearance, and forbade his men to
let them on board. Though his wife advised him to acknowledge them,
&lsquo;even if they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55"
name="pb55">55</a>]</span>were pigs or dogs,&rsquo; the unfilial son
persisted in turning them away. So they went back to the shore and sat
down and wept; and the old mother, laying her hand upon her shrivelled
breast, said, &lsquo;If thou art really my son, reared at my breast,
mayest thou be changed into stone.&rsquo; In response to her prayer,
milk came forth from her breast, and as she walked away, the ship and
all on board were turned into stone. The mother turned round once more
to look at her son, but the father did not, and by the power of God
they were both turned into trees of the species <i lang="ms">pauh</i>
(a kind of mango) one leaning seawards and the other towards the land.
The fruit of the seaward one is sweet, but that of the landward one is
bitter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The ship has now become a hill, and originally
was complete with all its furniture, but the Malays used to borrow the
plates and cups, etc., for feast days and did not return them, until at

&ldquo;Concerning the creation of Adam, here intimated, the Mohammedans
have several peculiar traditions. They say the angels Gabriel, Michael,
and Israfil were sent by God, one after another, to fetch for that
purpose seven handfuls of earth from different depths, and of different
colours (whence some account for the various complexions of mankind);
but the Earth being apprehensive of the consequence, and desiring them
to represent her fear to God that the creature He designed to form
would rebel against Him, and draw down His curse upon her, they
returned without performing God&rsquo;s command; whereupon He sent
Azrael on the same errand, who executed his commission without remorse,
for which reason God appointed that angel to separate the souls from
the bodies, being therefore called <i>the angel of death</i>. The earth
he had taken was carried into Arabia, to a place between Mecca and
Tayef, where, being first kneaded by the angels, it was afterwards
fashioned by God himself into a human form, and left to dry for the
space of forty days, or, as others say, as many years, the angels in
the meantime often visiting it, and Eblis (then one of the angels who
are nearest to God&rsquo;s presence, afterwards the devil) among the
rest; but he, not contented with looking on it, kicked it with his foot
till it rung, and knowing God designed that creature to be his
superior, took a secret resolution never to acknowledge him as such.
After this God animated the figure of clay and endued it with an
intelligent soul, and when He had placed him in paradise, formed Eve
out of his left side.&rdquo;&mdash;Sale&rsquo;s <i>Kor&acirc;n</i>, ch.

&ldquo;The Creator determined to make man, and for that purpose He took
some clay from the earth and fashioned it into the figure of a man.
Then He took the Spirit of Life to endue this body with vitality, and
placed the spirit on the head of the figure. But the spirit was strong,
and the body, being only clay, could not hold it, and was reft in
pieces and scattered into the air. Those fragments of the first great
Failure are the spirits of earth and sea and air.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The Creator then formed another clay
figure, but into this one He wrought some iron, so that when it
received the vital spark it withstood the strain and became Man. That
man was Adam, and the iron that is in the constitution of his
descendants has stood them in good stead. When they lose it they become
of little more account than their prototype the first
failure.&rdquo;&mdash;Swettenham, <i>Malay Sketches</i>, p.

speak personally, as when a set of models of the Selangor regalia were
being made for me, with the late Sultan&rsquo;s full permission and
knowledge, I found it impossible to get them made really like the
originals either in shape or size, the makers alleging their fear of
being struck dead in spite of this permission by this Divine Power or
&ldquo;Daulat&rdquo; if they were to imitate them too accurately. In
Perak the custom would appear to be less strict. Thus from <i>Malay
Sketches</i> (p. 215) we may gather that in the &ldquo;silver&rdquo;
state even the most sacred pieces of the regalia accompany the royal
party upon their annual expedition to seek for turtles&rsquo;

the extraordinary pretensions to sanctity which to this day (with, in

king:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The Sultan of <i>Menangcabow</i>, whose
residence is at <i>Pagarooyoong</i> (after pardon asked for presuming
to mention his name), who is king of kings, son of <i>Raja
Iscunder-zulcarnainny</i>, ... master of the third of the wood
<i>maccummat</i>, one of whose properties is to enable matter to fly;
of the lance ornamented with the beard of <i>Jangee</i>, of the palace
of the city of Rome; ... of the gold of twelve grains named <i>coodarat
coodarattee</i>, resembling a man; ... who is possessed of the sword
named <i>Chooree-se-mendong-geree</i>, which has an hundred and ninety
gaps, made in the conflict with the arch-devil, <i>Se Cattee-moono</i>,
whom it slew; who is master of fresh water in the ocean, to the extent
of a day&rsquo;s sailing; possessed of a lance formed of a twig of
<i>ejoo</i> (the <i>gomuti</i>, or sugar-palm); of a <i>calewang</i>
(scimitar) wrapped in an unmade <i>chinday</i> (cloth); of a
<i>creese</i> (dagger) formed of the soul of steel, which, by a noise,
expresses an unwillingness at being sheathed, and shows itself pleased
when drawn; of a date coeval with the creation; possessed of a gun
brought from heaven, named <i>soubahana hou ouatanalla</i>; of a horse
of the race of <i>sorimbor-ahnee</i>, superior to all others; Sultan of
the Burning Mountain, and of the mountains <i>goontang-goontang</i>,
which divide <i>Palembang</i> and <i>Jambee</i>; who may slay at
pleasure without being guilty of a crime; who is possessed of the
elephant named <i>settee dewa</i>; who is Vicegerent of Heaven; Sultan
of the Golden River; Lord of the Air and Clouds; master of a
<i>balli</i> (Audience-Hall), whose pillars are of the shrub
<i>jelattang</i>; of <i>gandangs</i> (drums) made of hollowed branches
of the minute shrubs <i>pooloot</i> and <i>seelosooree</i>; of the
<i>gong</i> that resounds to the skies; of the buffalo named <i>Se
Binnooang Sattee</i>, whose horns are ten feet asunder; of the
unconquered cock, <i>Sengonannee</i>; of the cocoa-nut tree whose
amazing height, and being infested with serpents and other noxious
reptiles, render it impossible to be climbed; of the flower named
<i>seeree menjeree</i>, of ambrosial scent; who, when he goes to sleep,
wakes not till the <i>gandang nobat</i> (state drum) sounds; one of
whose eyes is as the sun and the other as the
moon.&rdquo;&mdash;Marsden, <i>Hist. of Sum.</i> p. 270.</p>
<p class="par footnote">On the foregoing list I should like to remark
(1) that the necessity of asking pardon for mentioning the king&rsquo;s
name is considered by the Peninsular Malays to be as imperative as
ever. (2) The expression &ldquo;who is master of fresh water in the
ocean&rdquo; is explained by a passage in Leyden&rsquo;s <i>Malay
Annals</i> (p. 37), where, all the fresh water being exhausted,
&ldquo;Raja Sang Sapurba directed them to bring rotans and tie them in
circles and throw them in the water; then having himself descended into
a small boat, he inserted his feet into the water, within the circles
of bamboo (<i>sic</i>), and by the Power of God Almighty and the virtue
of a descendant of Raja Secander Zulkarneini, the water within these
circles became fresh, and all the crews supplied themselves with it,
and unto this day the fresh water is mixed with the salt at this
place.&rdquo; (3) The horse, which is usually called
&ldquo;S&#277;mbrani,&rdquo; is a magic steed, &ldquo;which could fly
through the air as well as swim through the water&rdquo; (Leyd.,
<i>Mal. Ann.</i> p. 17). (4) For the mountains Goontang-goontang (or
Saguntang Mahamiru), cp. Leyden&rsquo;s <i>Mal. Ann.</i> p. 20
<i>seqq.</i> (5) The privilege of &ldquo;slaying at pleasure without
being guilty of a crime&rdquo; is a privilege which still belongs to
Malay sovereigns of the first rank.</p>

<i>Marhum</i>, one who has found mercy, <i>i.e.</i> the deceased. It is
the custom of Malays to discontinue after the death of a king the use
of the title which he bore during his life. A new title is invented for
the deceased monarch, by which he is ever afterwards known. The
existence of a similar custom among other Indo-Chinese races has been
noticed by Colonel Yule: &ldquo;There is also a custom of dropping or
concealing the proper name of the king. This exists in Burma and
(according to La Loub&egrave;re) in Siam. The various kings of those
countries are generally distinguished by some nickname derived from
facts in their reign or personal relations, <i>and applied to them
after their decease</i>. Thus we hear among the Burmese kings of
&lsquo;the king dethroned by foreigners,&rsquo; &lsquo;the king who
fled from the Chinese,&rsquo; &lsquo;the grandfather king,&rsquo; and
even &lsquo;the king thrown into the water.&rsquo; Now this has a close
parallel in the Archipelago. Among the kings of Macassar, we find one
king known only as the &lsquo;Throat-cutter&rsquo;; another as
&lsquo;He who ran amuck&rsquo;; a third, &lsquo;The beheaded&rsquo;; a
fourth, &lsquo;He who was beaten to death on his own
stair-case.&rsquo;&rdquo; Colonel Yule ascribes the origin of this
custom to Ancient India. [Journal Anthrop. Institute.] <i>J.R.A.S.</i>,

<p class="par first">&ldquo;The accredited intermediary between men and
spirits is the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4099src" href="#xd21e4099" name="xd21e4099src">1</a> the <i lang=
"ms">Pawang</i> is a functionary of great and traditional importance in
a Malay village, though in places near towns the office is falling into
abeyance. In the inland districts, however, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>
is still a power, and is regarded as part of the constituted order of
society, without whom no village community would be complete. It must
be clearly understood that he has nothing whatever to do with the
official Muhammadan religion of the mosque; the village has its regular
staff of elders&mdash;the <i lang="ms">Im&#257;m</i>, <i lang=
"ms">Khatib</i>, and <i lang="ms">Bilal</i>&mdash;for the mosque
service. But the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> is quite outside this system,
and belongs to a different and much older order of ideas; he may be
regarded as the legitimate representative of the primitive
&lsquo;medicine-man&rsquo; or &lsquo;village-sorcerer,&rsquo; and his
very existence in these days is an anomaly, though it does not strike
Malays as such. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very often the office is hereditary, or at least
the appointment is practically confined to the members of one family.
Sometimes it is endowed with certain &lsquo;properties&rsquo; handed
down from one <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> to his successor, known as the
<i lang="ms">kab&#277;saran</i>, or, as it were, regalia. On one
occasion I was nearly called upon to decide whether these
adjuncts&mdash;which consisted, in this particular case, of a peculiar
kind of head-dress&mdash;were the personal property of the person then
in possession of them (who had got them from his father, a deceased
<i lang="ms">Pawang</i>), or were to be regarded as official insignia
descending with the office in the event of the natural heir declining
to serve! Fortunately I was spared the difficult task of deciding this
delicate point of law, as I managed to persuade the owner to take up
the appointment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But quite apart from such external marks of
dignity, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> is a person of very real
significance. In all agricultural operations, such as sowing, reaping,
irrigation works, and the clearing of jungle for planting, in fishing
at sea, in prospecting for minerals, and in cases of sickness, his
assistance is invoked. He is entitled by custom to certain small fees;
thus, after a good harvest he is allowed, in some villages, five
<i lang="ms">gantangs</i> of padi, one <i lang="ms">gantang</i> of rice
(<i lang="ms">b&#277;ras</i>), and two <i lang="ms">chupaks</i> of
<i lang="ms">&#277;mping</i> (a preparation of rice and cocoa-nut made
into a sort of sweetmeat) from each householder. After recovery from
sickness his remuneration is the very modest amount of <i lang=
"ms">tiga wang baharu</i>, that is, 7&frac12; cents.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is generally believed that a good harvest can
only be secured by complying with his instructions, which are of a
peculiar and comprehensive character.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They consist largely of prohibitions, which are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>known as <i lang="ms">pantang</i>. Thus, for
instance, it is <i lang="ms">pantang</i> in some places to work in the
rice-field on the 14th and 15th days of the lunar month; and this rule
of enforced idleness, being very congenial to the Malay character, is,
I believe, pretty strictly observed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Again, in reaping, certain instruments are
proscribed, and in the inland villages it is regarded as a great crime
to use the sickle (<i lang="ms">sabit</i>) for cutting the <i lang=
"ms">padi</i>; at the very least the first few ears should be cut with
a <i lang="ms">tuai</i>, a peculiar small instrument consisting of a
semicircular blade set transversely on a piece of wood or bamboo, which
is held between the fingers, and which cuts only an ear or two at a
time. Also the <i lang="ms">padi</i> must not be threshed by hitting it
against the inside of a box, a practice known as <i lang="ms">banting
padi</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In this, as in one or two other cases, it may be
supposed that the <i lang="ms">Pawang&rsquo;s</i> ordinances preserve
the older forms of procedure and are opposed to innovations in
agricultural methods. The same is true of the <i lang="ms">pantang</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> taboo) rule which prescribes a fixed rate of price at
which <i lang="ms">padi</i> may be sold in the village community to
members of the same village. This system of customary prices is
probably a very old relic of a time when the idea of asking a neighbour
or a member of your own tribe to pay a competition price for an article
was regarded as an infringement of communal rights. It applies to a few
other articles of local produce<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4203src"
href="#xd21e4203" name="xd21e4203src">2</a> besides <i lang=
"ms">padi</i>, and I was frequently assured <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>that the
neglect of this wholesome rule was the cause of bad harvests. I was
accordingly pressed to fine transgressors, which would perhaps have
been a somewhat difficult thing to do. The fact, however, that in many
places these rules are generally observed is a tribute to the influence
of the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> who lends his sanction to
them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4268src" href="#xd21e4268"
name="xd21e4268src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> keeps a familiar
spirit, which in his case is a <i lang="ms">hantu p&#365;saka</i>, that
is, an hereditary spirit which runs in the family, in virtue of which
he is able to deal summarily with the wild spirits of an obnoxious
character.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4285src" href="#xd21e4285"
name="xd21e4285src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">The foregoing description is so precise and clear that I
have not much to add to it. There are, however, one or two points which
require emphasis. One of these is that the priestly magician stands in
certain respects on the same footing as the divine man or
king&mdash;that is to say, he owns certain insignia which are exactly
analogous to the regalia of the latter, and are, as Mr. Blagden points
out, called by the same name (<i lang="ms">kab&#277;saran</i>). He
shares, moreover, with the king the right to make use of cloth dyed
with the royal colour (yellow), and, like the king, too, possesses the
right to enforce the use of certain ceremonial words and phrases, in
which respect, indeed, his list is longer, if anything, than that of
royalty.</p>
<p class="par">He also acts as a sort of spirit-medium and gives
oracles in trances; possesses considerable political influence;
practises (very occasional) austerities; observes some degree of
chastity, and appears quite sincere in his conviction of his own
powers. At least he always has a most plausible excuse ready to account
for his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>inability to do whatever is required. An aged
magician who came from Perak to doctor one of H.H. the Sultan&rsquo;s
sons (Raja Kahar) while I was at Langat, had the unusual reputation of
being able to raise a sandbank in the sea at will; but when I asked if
I could see it done, he explained that it could only be done in time of
war when he was hard pressed by an enemy&rsquo;s boat, and he could not
do it for the sake of mere ostentation! Moreover, like members of their
profession all the world over, these medicine-men are, perhaps
naturally, extremely reticent; it was seldom that they would let their
books be seen, much less copied, even for fair payment, and a Pawang
once refused to tell me a charm until I had taken my shoes off and was
seated with him upon a yellow cloth while he repeated the much-prized
formula.</p>
<p class="par">The office of magician is, as has been said, very often
hereditary. It is not so always, however, there being certain
recognised ways in which a man may &ldquo;get magic.&rdquo; One of the
most peculiar is as follows: &ldquo;To obtain magical powers (<i lang=
"ms">&#703;elmu</i>) you must meet the ghost of a murdered man. Take
the midrib of a leaf of the &lsquo;ivory&rsquo; cocoa-nut palm
(<i lang="ms">p&#277;l&#277;pah niyor gading</i>), which is to be laid
on the grave, and two more midribs, which are intended to represent
canoe-paddles, and carry them with the help of a companion to the grave
of the murdered man at the time of the full moon (the 15th day of the
lunar month) when it falls upon a Tuesday. Then take a cent&rsquo;s
worth of incense, with glowing embers in a censer, and carry them to
the head-post of the grave of the deceased. Fumigate the grave, going
three times round it, and call upon the murdered man by name:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Hearken, <i>So-and-so</i>,</p>
<p class="line">And assist me;</p>
<p class="line">I am taking (this boat) to the saints of God,</p>
<p class="line">And I desire to ask for a little magic.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4321src" href="#xd21e4321" name=
"xd21e4321src">5</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Here take the first midrib, fumigate it, and lay
it upon the head of the grave, repeating &lsquo;<i lang="ms">Kur
Allah</i>&rsquo; (&lsquo;Cluck, cluck, God!&rsquo;) seven times. You
and your companion must now take up a sitting posture, one at the head
and the other at the foot of the grave, facing the grave post, and use
the canoe-paddles which you have brought. In a little while the
surrounding scenery will change and take upon itself the appearance of
the sea, and finally an aged man will appear, to whom you must address
the same request as before.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Although officially the religious centre of
the village community is the mosque, there is usually in every small
district a holy place known as the <i lang="ms">kramat</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4368src" href="#xd21e4368" name="xd21e4368src">6</a>
at which vows are paid on special occasions, and which is invested with
a very high degree of reverence and sanctity. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;These <i lang="ms">kramats</i> abound in Malacca
territory; there is hardly a village but can boast some two or three in
its immediate neighbourhood, and they are perfectly well known to all
the inhabitants.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Theoretically, <i lang="ms">kramats</i> are
supposed to be the graves of deceased holy men, the early apostles of
the Muhammadan faith, the first founders of the village who cleared the
primeval jungle, or other persons of local notoriety in a former age;
and there is no doubt that many of them are that and nothing more. But
even so, the reverence paid to them and the ceremonies that are
performed at them savour a good deal too much of ancestor-worship to be
attributable to an orthodox Muhammadan origin.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is certain, however, that many of these
<i lang="ms">kramats</i> are not graves at all: many of them are in the
jungle, on hills and in groves, like the high places of the Old
Testament idolatries; they contain no trace of a grave (while those
that are found in villages usually have grave-stones), and they appear
to be really ancient sites of a primitive nature-worship or the
adoration of the spirits of natural objects.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Malays, when asked to account for them, often
have recourse to the explanations that they are <i lang="ms">kramat
jin</i>, that is, &ldquo;spirit&rdquo;-places; and if a Malay is
pressed on the point, and thinks that the orthodoxy of these practices
is being impugned, he will sometimes add that the <i lang="ms">jin</i>
in question is a <i lang="ms">jin isl&#257;m</i>, a Muhammadan and
quite orthodox spirit!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thus on Bukit Nyalas, near the Johol frontier,
there is a <i lang="ms">kramat</i> consisting of a group of granite
boulders on a ledge of rock overhanging a sheer descent of a good many
feet; bamboo clumps grow on the place, and there were traces of
religious rites having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63"
name="pb63">63</a>]</span>been performed there, but no grave whatever.
This place was explained to me to be the <i lang="ms">kramat</i> of one
Nakhoda Hussin, described as a <i lang="ms">jin</i> (of the orthodox
variety), who presides over the water, rain, and streams. People
occasionally burned incense there to avert drought and get enough water
for irrigating their fields. There was another <i lang="ms">kramat</i>
of his lower down the hill, also consisting of rocks, one of which was
shaped something like a boat. I was informed that this <i lang=
"ms">jin</i> is attended by tigers which guard the hill, and are very
jealous of the intrusion of other tigers from the surrounding country.
He is believed to have revealed himself to the original <i lang=
"ms">Pawang</i> of the village, the mythical founder of the <i lang=
"ms">kampong</i> of Nyalas. In a case like this it seems probable that
the name attached to this object of reverence is a later accretion, and
that under a thin disguise we have here a relic of the worship of the
spirit of rivers and streams, a sort of elemental deity localised in
this particular place, and still regarded as a proper object of worship
and propitiation, in spite of the theoretically strict monotheism of
the Muhammadan creed. Again, at another place the <i lang=
"ms">kramat</i> is nothing but a tree, of somewhat singular shape,
having a large swelling some way up the trunk. It was explained to me
that this tree was connected in a special way with the prospects of
local agriculture, the size of the swelling increasing in good years
and diminishing in bad seasons! Hence it was naturally regarded with
considerable awe by the purely agricultural population of the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As may be imagined, it is exceedingly difficult
to discover any authentic facts regarding the history of these numerous
<i lang="ms">kramats</i>: even where there is some evidence of the
existence of a grave, the name of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>departed saint is usually
the one fact that is remembered, and often even that is forgotten. The
most celebrated of the Malacca <i lang="ms">kramats</i>, the one at
Machap, is a representative type of the first class, that in which
there really is a grave: it is the one place where a hardened liar
respects the sanctity of an oath, and it is occasionally visited in
connection with civil cases, when the one party challenges the other to
take a particular oath. A man who thinks nothing of perjuring himself
in the witness-box, and who might not much mind telling a lie even with
the Kor&#257;n on his head, will flinch before the ordeal of a
falsehood in the presence of the Dato&rsquo; Machap.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4459src" href="#xd21e4459" name=
"xd21e4459src">7</a></p>
<p class="par">After explaining the difference between beneficent
spirits and the spirits of evil, Mr. Blagden continues: &ldquo;Some
time ago one of these objectionable <i lang="ms">hantus</i> (spirits of
evil) had settled down in a <i lang="ms">k&#277;rayong</i> tree in the
middle of this village of Bukit S&#277;nggeh, and used to frighten
people who passed that way in the dusk; so the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>
was duly called upon to exorcise it, and under his superintendence the
tree was cut down, after which there was no more trouble. But it is
certain that it would have been excessively dangerous for an ordinary
layman to do so.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This point may be illustrated by a case which was
reported to me soon after it occurred, and which again shows the
intimate connection of spirits with trees. A Javanese coolie, on the
main road near Ayer Panas, cut down a tree which was known to be
occupied by a <i lang="ms">hantu</i>. He was thereupon seized with
what, from the description, appears to have been an epileptic fit, and
showed all the traditional symptoms of demoniac <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>possession. He did not recover till his friends
had carried out the directions of the spirit, speaking through the
sufferer&rsquo;s mouth, it seems, viz., to burn incense, offer rice,
and release a fowl. After which the <i lang="ms">hantu</i> left
him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In many places there are trees which are pretty
generally believed to be the abodes of spirits, and not one Malay in
ten would venture to cut one down, while most people would hardly dare
to go near one after dark. On one occasion an exceptionally intelligent
Malay, with whom I was discussing the terms on which he proposed to
take up a contract for clearing the banks of a river, made it an
absolute condition that he should not be compelled to cut down a
particular tree which overhung the stream, on the ground that it was a
&lsquo;spirit&rsquo; tree. That tree had to be excluded from the
contract.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4491src" href="#xd21e4491"
name="xd21e4491src">8</a></p>
<p class="par">The following description, by Sir W. Maxwell, of a Perak
<i lang="ms">kramat</i> may be taken as fairly typical of the <i lang=
"ms">kramat</i>, in which there really is a grave:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Rightly or wrongly the Malays of Larut assign an
Achinese origin to an old grave which was discovered in the forest some
years ago, and of which I propose to give a brief description. It is
situated about half-way between the Larut Residency and the mining
village of Kamunting. In the neighbourhood the old durian trees of Java
betoken the presence of a Malay population at a date long prior to the
advent of the Chinese miner. The grave was discovered about twenty
years ago by workmen employed by the M&#277;ntri of Perak to make the
Kamunting road, and it excited much curiosity among the Malays at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>time. The M&#277;ntri and all the ladies of his
family went on elephants to see it, and it has been an object of much
popular prestige ever since.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Malays of Java were able from the village
tradition to give the name and sex of the occupant of this lonely tomb,
&lsquo;Toh Bidan Susu Lanjut,&rsquo; whose name sounds better in the
original than in an English translation. She is said to have been an
old Achinese woman of good family; of her personal history nothing is
known, but her claims to respectability are evinced by the carved head
and foot stones of Achinese workmanship which adorn her grave, and her
sanctity is proved by the fact that the stones are eight feet apart. It
is a well-known Malay superstition that the stones placed to mark the
graves of Saints miraculously increase their relative distance during
the lapse of years, and thus bear mute testimony to the holiness of the
person whose resting-place they mark.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">kramat</i> on the Kamunting road
is on the spur of a hill through which the roadway is cut. A tree
overshadows the grave and is hung with strips of white cloth and other
rags (<i lang="ms">panji panji</i>) which the devout have put there.
The direction of the grave is as nearly as possible due north and
south. The stones at its head and foot are of the same size, and in
every respect identical one with the other. They are of sandstone, and
are said by the natives to have been brought from Achin. In design and
execution they are superior to ordinary Malay art, as will be seen, I
think, on reference to the rubbings of the carved surface of one of
them, which have been executed for me by the Larut Survey Office, and
which I have transmitted to the Society with this paper. The extreme
measurements of the stones (furnished from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>the same
source) are 2&prime; 1&Prime; &times; 0&prime; 9&Prime; &times;
0&prime; 7&Prime;. They are in excellent preservation, and the carving
is fresh and sharp. Some Malays profess to discover in the three rows
of vertical direction on the broadest face of the slabs the Mohammedan
attestation of the unity of God (<i lang="ms">La ilaha illa-lla</i>)
repeated over and over again; but I confess that I have been unable to
do so. The offerings at a <i lang="ms">kramat</i> are generally incense
(<i lang="ms">istangi</i> or <i lang="ms">satangi</i>) or benzoin
(<i lang="ms">kaminian</i>); these are burned in little stands made of
bamboo rods; one end is stuck in the ground and the other split into
four or five, and then opened out and plaited with basket work so as to
hold a little earth. They are called <i lang="ms">sangka</i>; a Malay
will often vow that if he succeeds in some particular project, or gets
out of some difficulty in which he may happen to be placed, he will
burn three or more <i lang="ms">sangka</i> at such and such a <i lang=
"ms">kramat</i>. Persons who visit a <i lang="ms">kramat</i> in times
of distress or difficulty, to pray and to vow offerings, in case their
prayers are granted, usually leave behind them as tokens of their vows
small pieces of white cloth, which are tied to the branches of a tree
or to sticks planted in the ground near the sacred spot. For votary
purposes the long-forgotten tomb of Toh Bidan Susu Lanjut enjoys
considerable popularity among the Mohammedans of Larut; and the tree
which overshadows it has, I am glad to say, been spared the fate which
awaited the rest of the jungle which overhung the road. No coolie was
bold enough to put an axe to it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">Mr. George Bellamy, writing in 1893, thus described the
<i lang="ms">kramat</i> at Tanjong Karang in the Kuala Selangor
district:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">kramat</i> about which I am now
writing is a very remarkable one. It is situated on the extreme point
of land at the mouth of the river Selangor, close to where the new
lighthouse has been erected. A magnificent <i lang="ms">kayu ara</i> (a
kind of fig-tree) forms a prominent feature of the <i lang=
"ms">tanjong</i> (point or cape), and at the base of this tree,
enveloped entirely by its roots, is an oblong-shaped space having the
appearance of a Malay grave, with the headstones complete.... To this
sacred spot constant pilgrimages are made by the Malays, and the lower
branches of the tree rarely lack those pieces of white and yellow cloth
which are always hung up as an indication that some devout person has
paid his vows. The Chinese also have great respect for this <i lang=
"ms">kramat</i>, and have erected a sort of sylvan temple at the foot
of the tree.&rdquo; Mr. Bellamy tells how one Raja &#703;Abdullah fell
in love with a maiden named Miriam, who disappeared and was supposed to
have been taken by the spirits (though she was really carried off by an
earlier lover named Hassan). Raja &#703;Abdullah died and was buried at
the foot of the fig-tree. Mr. Bellamy concludes: &ldquo;If you ever
happen to see a very big crocodile at the mouth of the Selangor river,
floating listlessly about, be careful not to molest it: it is but the
<i lang="ms">buaya kramat</i>, which shape the spirit of Raja
&#703;Abdullah sometimes assumes. When walking along the <i lang=
"ms">pantai</i> (shore), if you chance to meet a very large tiger let
him pass unharmed. It is only Raja &#703;Abdullah&rsquo;s ghost, and in
proof thereof you will see it leaves no footmarks on the sand. And when
you go to see the new lighthouse at Tanjong Kramat, you may perhaps
come face to face with a very old man, who sadly shakes his head and
disappears. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>Do not be startled, it is only Raja
&#703;Abdullah.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4591src" href=
"#xd21e4591" name="xd21e4591src">10</a></p>
<p class="par">In No. 2 of the same volume of the <i>Selangor
Journal</i> Mr. Bellamy refers to another <i lang=
"ms">kramat</i>&mdash;that of &rsquo;Toh K&#277;tapang&mdash;which he
appears to localise in Ulu Selangor.</p>
<p class="par">It is by no means necessary to ensure the popularity of
a <i lang="ms">kramat</i> or shrine that the saint to whose memory it
is dedicated should be a Malay. The cosmopolitan character of these
shrines is attested in the following note which I sent to the
<i>Selangor Journal</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4613src" href=
"#xd21e4613" name="xd21e4613src">11</a> about the shrines in the Ulu
Langat (Kajang) district of Selangor:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The chief <i lang="ms">kramats</i> in the
district are &lsquo;Makam &rsquo;Toh Sayah&rsquo; (the tomb of a
Javanese of high repute); &lsquo;Makam Said Idris,&rsquo; at Rekoh,
Said Idris being the father of the P&#277;nghulu of Cheras;
&lsquo;Makam &rsquo;Toh Janggut<span class="corr" id="xd21e4623" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> (a &lsquo;Kampar&rsquo; man), on the
road to Cheras; and &lsquo;Makam &rsquo;Toh Gerdu or Berdu,&rsquo; at
Dusun Tua, Ulu Langat. &rsquo;Toh Berdu was of Sakai origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I have never yet, however, heard of any shrine being
dedicated to a Chinaman, and it is probable that this species of
canonisation is confined (at least in modern times) to local
celebrities professing the Muhammadan religion, as would certainly be
the case of the Malays and Javanese mentioned in the foregoing
paragraph, and quite possibly too in the case of the Sakai.</p>
<p class="par">It is true that Chinese often worship at these
shrines&mdash;just as, on the same principle, they employ Malay
magicians in prospecting for tin; but there appear to be certain limits
beyond which they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70"
name="pb70">70</a>]</span>cannot go, as it was related to me when I was
living in the neighbourhood, that a Chinaman who had, in the innocence
of his heart, <i>offered at a Moslem shrine a piece of the accursed
pork</i>, was pounced upon and slain before he reached home by one of
the tigers which guarded the shrine.</p>
<p class="par">The shrine of &rsquo;Toh Kamarong is one of the most
celebrated shrines in the Langat district, the saint&rsquo;s last
resting-place being guarded by a white elephant and a white tiger, the
latter of which had been a pet (<i lang="ms">p&#277;mainan</i>) of his
during his lifetime. In this respect it is exactly similar to the
shrine of &rsquo;Toh Parwi of Pantei in Sungei Ujong, which is
similarly guarded, both shrines having been erected on the seashore, it
is said, in the days when the sea came much farther inland than it does
at present. The fame of &rsquo;Toh Kamarong filled the neighbourhood,
and it is related that on one occasion an irate mother exclaimed, of a
son of hers who was remarkable for his vicious habits, &ldquo;May the
&rsquo;Toh Kramat Kamarong fly away with him.&rdquo; Next day the boy
disappeared, and all search proved fruitless, until three days later
&rsquo;Toh Kamarong appeared to her in a dream, and informed her that
he had carried the boy off, as she had invited him to do, and that if
she were to look for his footprints she would be able to discover them
inside the pad-tracks of a tiger one of whose feet was smaller than the
rest, and which was then haunting the spot. She did so, and discovered
her son&rsquo;s footprints exactly as the saint had foretold. This
Ghost-tiger, which no doubt must be identified with &rsquo;Toh
Kamarong&rsquo;s &ldquo;pet,&rdquo; used to roam the district when I
was stationed in the neighbourhood, and both I and, I believe, the then
District Engineer (Mr. Spearing), saw this tiger&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>tracks,
and can vouch for the fact that one footprint was smaller than the
rest. This curious feature is thought by the local Malays at least, to
be one of the specially distinctive marks of a <i lang="ms">rimau
kramat</i>, or Ghost-tiger, just as the possession of one tusk that is
smaller than the other is the mark of a Ghost-elephant.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4646src" href="#xd21e4646" name=
"xd21e4646src">12</a></p>
<p class="par">Closely connected with the subject of shrines is that of
high places, such as those spots where religious penance was
traditionally practised. One of these sacred spots is said to have been
situated upon the &ldquo;Mount Ophir&rdquo; of Malacca, which is about
4000 feet high, and on which a certain legendary Princess known as Tuan
P&#365;tri Gunong Ledang is said to have dwelt, until she transferred
her ghostly court to Jugra Hill, upon the coast of Selangor.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4653src" href="#xd21e4653" name=
"xd21e4653src">13</a></p>
<p class="par">Such fasting-places are usually, as in Java, either
solitary hills or places which present some great natural peculiarity;
even remarkable trees and rocks being, as has already been pointed out,
pressed into the service of this Malay &ldquo;natural
religion.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The main divisions of the magico-religious
ceremonies of the Malays are prayer, sacrifice, lustration, fasting,
divination, and possession.</p>
<p class="par">Prayer, which is defined by Professor Tylor as &ldquo;a
request made to a deity as if he were a man,&rdquo; is still in the
unethical stage among the Malays; no request <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>for
anything but personal advantages of a material character being ever, so
far as I am aware, preferred by the worshipper. The efficacy of prayer
is, however, often supposed to be enhanced by repetition.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As prayer is a request made to a deity as if he
were a man, so sacrifice is a gift made to a deity as if he were a
man.... The ruder conception that the deity takes and values the
offering for itself, gives place, on the one hand, to the idea of mere
homage as expressed by a gift, and, on the other, to the negative view
that the virtue lies in the worshipper depriving himself of something
prized.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4682src" href="#xd21e4682"
name="xd21e4682src">14</a></p>
<p class="par">A general survey of the charms and ceremonies brought
together in this volume will, I think, be likely to establish the view
that the Malays (in accordance with the reported practice of many other
races) probably commenced with the idea of sacrifice as a simple gift,
and therefrom developed first the idea of ceremonial homage, and later
the idea of sacrifice as an act of abnegation. Evidences of the
original gift-theory chiefly survive in the language of charms, in
which the deity appealed to is repeatedly invited to eat and drink of
the offerings placed before him, as a master may be invited to eat by
his servants. The intermediate stage between the gift and homage
theories is marked by an extensive use of &ldquo;substitutes,&rdquo;
and of the sacrifice of a part or parts for the whole. Thus we even
find the dough model of a human being actually called &ldquo;the
substitute&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">tukar ganti</i>), and offered up to the
spirits upon the sacrificial tray; in the same sense are the
significant directions of a magician, that &ldquo;<i>if the spirit
craves a human victim a cock may be substituted</i>&rdquo; and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>custom of hunters who, when they have killed a
deer, leave behind them in the forest small portions of each of the
more important members of the deer&rsquo;s anatomy, as
&ldquo;representatives&rdquo; of the entire carcase. In this last case
the usual &ldquo;ritualistic change may be traced from practical
reality to formal ceremony.&rdquo; &ldquo;The originally valuable
offering is compromised for a smaller tribute or a cheaper substitute,
dwindling at last to a mere trifling token or symbol.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4698src" href="#xd21e4698" name=
"xd21e4698src">15</a></p>
<p class="par">This homage-theory will, I believe, be found to cover by
far the greater bulk of the sacrifices usually offered by Malays, and
the idea of abnegation appears to be practically confined to votal
ceremonies or vows (<i lang="ms">niat</i>), in which the nature and
extent of the offering are not regulated by custom, but depend entirely
upon the wealth or caprice of the worshipper, there being merely a
tacit understanding that he shall sacrifice something which is of more
than nominal value to himself.</p>
<p class="par">Of the manner in which offerings are supposed to be
received by the deity to whom they are offered it is difficult to
obtain very much evidence. I have, however, frequently questioned
Malays upon this subject, and on the whole think it can very safely be
said that the deity is not supposed to touch the solid or material part
of the offering, but only the essential part, whether it be
&ldquo;life, savour, essence, quality&rdquo; or even the
&ldquo;soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It will perhaps be advisable, in order to avoid
repetition, to describe a few of the special and distinctive sub-rites
which form part of many of the more important ceremonies, such as (in
particular), rites performed at shrines, the rite of burning incense,
the scattering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>of (or banqueting upon) sacrificial rice, and the
application of the &ldquo;Neutralising&rdquo; Rice-paste (<i lang=
"ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>).</p>
<p class="par">Of the rites performed at shrines, Mr. Blagden says:
&ldquo;The worship there, as with most other <i lang="ms">kramats</i>,
consists of the burning of incense, the offering of <i lang="ms">nasi
kunyet</i> (yellow rice), and the killing of goats; but I also noticed
a number of live pigeons there which illustrate the practice, common in
Buddhist countries, of releasing an animal in order to gain
&lsquo;merit&rsquo; thereby.&rdquo; At a shrine on the Langat river I
have seen fowls which had (I was told) been similarly released.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Blagden&rsquo;s remarks apply with equal force to
the services performed at the shrines of Selangor, and I believe also
of other States. It should, however, I think, be pointed out that the
<i lang="ms">nasi kunyit</i> (yellow rice) is, usually at all events,
eaten by those who take part in the service. At a ceremony which was
held on one occasion after my recovery from sickness, and in which, by
request, I took part,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4731src" href=
"#xd21e4731" name="xd21e4731src">16</a> incense was burnt, and
Muhammadan prayers chanted, after which the usual strip of white cloth
(five cubits in length) was laid upon the saint&rsquo;s grave (the
saint being the father of the present Sultan of Selangor), and the
party then adjourned to a shelter some twenty or thirty yards lower
down the hill, where, first the men, and then the women and children,
partook of the flesh of the slaughtered goat and the saffron-stained
rice (<i lang="ms">pulut</i>). After the meal the Bilal (mosque
attendant, who was present with the Malay headman and the local priest
of the mosque), returned to the tomb, and making obeisance, recited a
Muhammadan prayer, craving permission <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>to take the cloth back
for his own use, which he presently did. These Bilals are needy men and
live upon the alms of the devout, so I suppose he thought there was no
reason why the saint should not contribute something to his
support.</p>
<p class="par">The burning of incense is one of the very simplest, and
hence commonest, forms of burnt sacrifice. Some magicians say that it
should be accompanied by an invocation addressed to the Spirit of
Incense, which should be besought, as in the example quoted below, to
&ldquo;pervade the seven tiers of earth and sky respectively.&rdquo; It
would appear that the intention of the worshipper is to ensure that his
&ldquo;sacrifice of sweet savour&rdquo; should reach the nostrils of
the gods and help to propitiate them, wherever they may be, by means of
a foretaste of offerings to follow. This invocation, however, is not
unfrequently omitted, or at least slurred over by the worshipper, in
spite of the contention of the magicians who use it, that
&ldquo;without it the spell merely rises like smoke which is blown away
by the wind.&rdquo; The following is one form of the invocation in
question:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Zabur<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4747src" href=

<p class="par first">The direction taken by the fumes of the incense is
observed and noted for the purpose of divination; this feature of the
rite will be noticed under the heading of Medicine.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4793src" href="#xd21e4793" name="xd21e4793src">19</a></p>
<p class="par">Another form of sacrifice consists in the scattering of
rice. The sacrificial rice (<i lang="la">Oryza sativa</i>) used in the
ceremonies is always of the following kinds: firstly, parched rice
(<i lang="ms">b&rsquo;ras b&#277;rtih</i>); secondly, washed rice
(<i lang="ms">b&rsquo;ras basoh</i>); thirdly, saffron-stained rice
(<i lang="ms">b&rsquo;ras kunyit</i>, <i>i.e.</i> rice stained with
turmeric);<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4819src" href="#xd21e4819" name=
"xd21e4819src">20</a> and, finally, a special kind of glutinous rice
called <i lang="ms">pulut</i> (<i lang="la">Oryza glutinosa</i>), which
is also very generally used for sacrificial banquets.</p>
<p class="par">Of these, the parched rice is generally used for
strewing the bottom of the sacrificial tray (<i lang="ms">anchak</i>)
when the framework has been covered with banana leaves, but the
offerings have not yet been deposited within it.</p>
<p class="par">The washed and saffron rice are generally used for
scattering either over the persons to be benefited by the ceremony, or
else upon the ground or house-floor.</p>
<p class="par">With reference to the selection of rice for this
purpose, it has been suggested that the rice is intended to attract
what may be called the &ldquo;bird-soul&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> the soul of
man conceived as a bird) to the spot, or to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>keep it
from straying at a particularly dangerous moment in the life of its
owner.</p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="ms">pulut</i> or glutinous rice is the kind
of rice generally used for sacrificial banquets, <i>e.g.</i> for
banquets at &ldquo;high places,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p class="par">Lustration is generally accomplished either by means of
fire or of water. The best examples of the former are perhaps the
fumigation of infants, and the <i lang="ms">api saleian</i> or
purificatory fire, over which women are half-roasted when a birth has
taken place, but these being special and distinctive ceremonies, will
be described with others of the same nature in Chapter VI.</p>
<p class="par">One of the forms of lustration by water, however,
appears rather to take the place of a sub-rite, forming an integral
portion of a large class of ceremonies, such as those relating to
Building, Fishing, Agriculture, Marriage, and so forth. Hence it will
be necessary to give a general sketch of its leading features in the
present context.</p>
<p class="par">The ceremony of lustration by water, when it takes the
form of the sub-rite referred to, is called &ldquo;T&#277;pong
Tawar,&rdquo; which properly means &ldquo;the Neutralising Rice-flour
(Water),&rdquo; &ldquo;neutralising&rdquo; being used almost in a
chemical sense, <i>i.e.</i> in the sense of &ldquo;sterilising&rdquo;
the active element of poisons, or of destroying the active
potentialities of evil spirits.</p>
<p class="par">The rite itself consists in the application<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4873src" href="#xd21e4873" name=
"xd21e4873src">21</a> of a thin paste made by mixing rice-flour with
water: this is taken up in a brush or &ldquo;bouquet&rdquo; of leaves
and applied to the objects which the &ldquo;neutralisation&rdquo; is
intended to protect or neutralise, whether they be the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>posts of
a house, the projecting ends of a boat&rsquo;s ribs (<i lang="ms">tajok
p&rsquo;rahu</i>), the seaward posts of fishing-stakes (<i lang=
"ms">puchi kelong</i>), or the forehead and back of the hands of the
bride and bridegroom.</p>
<p class="par">The brush must be first fumigated with incense, then
dipped into the bowl which contains the rice-water, and shaken out
almost dry, for if the water runs down the object to which it is
applied it is held to &ldquo;portend tears,&rdquo; whereas if it
spreads equally all round (<i lang="ms">benchar</i>) it is lucky. The
composition of the brush, which is considered to be of the highest
importance, appears to vary, but only within certain limits. It almost
invariably, in Selangor, consists of a selection of leaves from the
following plants, which are made up in small bouquets of five, seven,
or nine leaves each, and bound round with <i lang="ms">ribu-ribu</i> (a
kind of small creeper), or a string of shredded tree bark (<i lang=
"ms">daun t&rsquo;rap</i>).</p>
<p class="par">The following is a list of the leaves generally
used:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">1. Leaves of the grass called <i lang="ms">sambau
dara</i>, which is said to be the symbol of a &ldquo;settled

<p class="par">Further inquiry and the collection of additional
material will no doubt help to elucidate the general principles on
which such selections are made. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81"
href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Short rhyming charms are very often used as
accompaniments of the rite of rice-water, but appear to be seldom if
ever repeated aloud. The following is a specimen, and others will be
found in the Appendix:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5140src" href=
"#xd21e5140" name="xd21e5140src">26</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">And, thirdly, Rice-paste of Kadangsa!</p>
<p class="line">Keep me from sickness, keep me from death,</p>
<p class="line">Keep me from injury and ruin.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Other not less important developments of the idea
of lustration by water are to be found in such ceremonies as the
bathing of mother and child after a birth and the washing of the floor
(<i lang="ms">basoh lantei</i>) upon similar occasions, the bathing of
the sick, of bride and bridegroom at weddings, of corpses (<i lang=
"ms">m&#277;ruang</i>),<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5165src" href=
"#xd21e5165" name="xd21e5165src">27</a> and the annual bathing
expeditions (<i lang="ms">mandi Safar</i>), which are supposed to
purify the persons of the bathers and to protect them from evil
(<i lang="ms">tolak bala</i>).</p>
<p class="par">Fasting, or the performance of religious penance, which
is now but seldom practised, would appear to have been only undertaken
in former days with a definite object in view, such as the production
of the state of mental exaltation which induces ecstatic visions, the
acquisition of supernatural powers (<i lang="ms">sakti</i>), and so
forth.</p>
<p class="par">The fast always took place, of course, in a solitary
spot, and not unfrequently upon the top of some high and solitary hill
such as Mount Ophir (Gunong Ledang), on the borders of Malacca
territory. Frequently, however, much lower hills, or even plains which
possessed some remarkable rock or tree, would be selected for the
purpose.</p>
<p class="par">Such fasting, however, did not, as sometimes with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>us, convey to the Malays the idea of complete
abstinence, as the magicians informed me that a small modicum of rice
contained in a <i lang="ms">k&#277;tupat</i> (which is a small
diamond-shaped rice-receptacle made of plaited cocoa-nut leaf) was the
daily &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; of any one who was fasting. The result
was that fasts might be almost indefinitely prolonged, and the
thrice-seven-days&rsquo; fast of &rsquo;Che Utus upon Jugra Hill, on
the Selangor coast,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5190src" href=
"#xd21e5190" name="xd21e5190src">28</a> is still one of the traditions
of that neighbourhood, whilst in Malay romances and in Malay tradition
this form of religious penance is frequently represented as continuing
for years.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, I would draw attention to the strong vein of
Sympathetic Magic or &ldquo;make believe&rdquo; which runs through and
leavens the whole system of Malay superstition. The root-idea of this
form of magic has been said to be the principle that &ldquo;cause
follows from effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One of the principles of sympathetic magic is
that any effect may be produced by imitating it.... If it is wished to
kill a person, an image of him is made and then destroyed; and it is
believed that through a certain physical sympathy between the person
and his image, the man feels the injuries done to the image as if they
were done to his own body, and that when it is destroyed he must
simultaneously perish.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5198src" href=
"#xd21e5198" name="xd21e5198src">29</a></p>
<p class="par">The principle thus described is perhaps the most
important of all those which underlie the &ldquo;Black Art&rdquo; of
the Malays. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=

District officers will be proud to know that in this last sense the

<p class="par first">A careful investigation of the magic rites and
charms used by a nation which has changed its religion will not
unfrequently show, that what is generally called witchcraft is merely
the <i lang="fr">d&eacute;bris</i> of the older ritual, condemned by
the priests of the newer faith, but yet stubbornly, though secretly,
persisting, through the unconquerable religious conservatism of the
mass of the people.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is nothing that clings longer to a race
than the religious faith in which it has been nurtured. Indeed, it is
impossible for any mind that is not thoroughly scientific to cast off
entirely the religious forms of thought in which it has grown to
maturity. Hence in every people that has received the impression of
foreign beliefs, we find that the latter do not expel and supersede the
older religion, but are engrafted on it, blent with it, or overlie it.
Observances are more easily abandoned than ideas, and even when all the
external forms of the alien faith have been put on, and few vestiges of
the indigenous one remain, the latter still retains its vitality in the
mind, and powerfully colours or corrupts the former. The actual
religion of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=

<p class="par">&ldquo;The general principle stated by Logan in the
passage just quoted receives remarkable illustration from a close
investigation of the folk-lore and superstitious beliefs of the Malays.
Two successive religious changes have taken place among them, and when
we have succeeded in identifying the vestiges of Brahmanism which
underlie the external forms of the faith of Muhammad, long established
in all Malay kingdoms, we are only half-way through our
task.<span class="corr" id="xd21e5239" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There yet remain the powerful influences of the
still earlier indigenous faith to be noted and accounted for. Just as
the Buddhists of Ceylon turn in times of sickness and danger, not to
the consolations offered by the creed of Buddha, but to the
propitiation of the demons feared and reverenced by their early
progenitors, and just as the Burmese and Talaings, though Buddhists,
retain in full force the whole of the <i>Nat</i> superstition, so among
the Malays, in spite of centuries which have passed since the
establishment of an alien worship, the Muhammadan peasant may be found
invoking the protection of Hindu gods against the spirits of evil with
which his primitive faith has peopled all natural
objects.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5247src" href="#xd21e5247"
name="xd21e5247src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What was the faith of Malaya seven hundred years
ago it is hard to say, but there is a certain amount of evidence to
lead to the belief that it was a form of Brahmanism, and that, no
doubt, had succeeded the original spirit worship.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5257src" href="#xd21e5257" name="xd21e5257src">3</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=

<p class="par">The evidence of folk-lore, taken in conjunction with
that supplied by charm-books and romances, goes to show that the
greater gods of the Malay Pantheon, though modified in some respects by
Malay ideas, were really borrowed Hindu divinities, and that only the
lesser gods and spirits are native to the Malay religious system. It is
true that some of these native gods can be with more or less
distinctness identified with the great powers of nature: the King of
the Winds (Raja Angin) for instance; &ldquo;Mambang Tali Harus,&rdquo;
or the god of mid-currents (the Malay Neptune); the gods of thunder and
lightning, of the celestial bodies, etc.; but none of them appear to
have the status of the chief gods of the Hindu system, and both by land
and water the terrible Shiva (&ldquo;Batara Guru&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Kala&rdquo;) is supreme. Yet each department of nature, however
small, has its own particular godling or spirit who requires
propitiation, and influences for good or evil every human action. Only
the moral element is wanting to the divine hegemony&mdash;the
&ldquo;cockeyed,&rdquo; limping substitute which does duty for it
reflecting only too truthfully the character of the people with whom it
passes as divine.</p>
<p class="par">I will first take, in detail, the gods of Hindu origin.
&ldquo;Batara (or B&#277;tara) Guru&rdquo; is &ldquo;the name by which
Siva is known to his worshippers, who constitute the vast majority of
the Balinese, and who probably constituted the bulk of the old
Javanese.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5268src" href="#xd21e5268"
name="xd21e5268src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">In the magic of the Peninsular Malays we find Vishnu the
Preserver, Brahma the Creator, Batara Guru, Kala, and S&rsquo;ri
simultaneously appealed to by the Malay magician; and though it would,
perhaps, be rash, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86"
name="pb86">86</a>]</span>(as Mr. Wilkinson says), to infer
<i>solely</i> from Malay romances or Malay theatrical invocations (many
of which owe much to Javanese influence), that Hinduism was the more
ancient religion of the Malays, there is plenty of other evidence to
prove that the &ldquo;Batara Guru&rdquo; of the Malays (no less than
the Batara Guru of Bali and Java) is none other than the recognised
father of the Hindu Trinity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5284src" href=
"#xd21e5284" name="xd21e5284src">5</a></p>
<p class="par">Of the greater deities or gods, Batara Guru is
unquestionably the greatest. &ldquo;In the Hikayat Sang Samba (the
Malay version of the Bhaumakavya), Batara Guru appears as a supreme
God, with Brahma and Vishnu as subordinate deities. It is Batara Guru
who alone has the water of life (<i lang="ms">ayer utama (atama)
jiwa</i>) which brings the slaughtered heroes to life.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5330src" href="#xd21e5330" name=
"xd21e5330src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">So to this day the Malay magician declares that
&rsquo;Toh Batara Guru (under any one of the many corruptions which his
name now bears<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5340src" href="#xd21e5340"
name="xd21e5340src">7</a>) was &ldquo;the all-powerful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>spirit
who held the place of Allah before the advent of Muhammadanism, a
spirit so powerful that he could restore the dead to life; and to him
all prayers were addressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Wilkinson, in the article from which we have already
quoted, deals with another point of interest, the expression <i lang=
"ms">sang-yang</i>, or <i lang="ms">batara</i>, which is prefixed to
<i lang="ms">guru</i>. After pointing out that <i lang="ms">yang</i> in
this case is not the ordinary Malay pronoun (<i lang="ms">yang</i>,
who), but an old word meaning a &ldquo;deity,&rdquo; he remarks, that
so far as he has been able to discover, it is only used of the
<i>greater</i> Hindu divinities, and not of inferior deities or
demi-gods. Thus we find it applied to Shiva and Vishnu, but never to
the monkey-god Hanuman, or a deity of secondary importance like
Dermadewa. Such inferior divinities have only <i>the lesser
honorific</i> &ldquo;sang&rdquo; prefixed to their names, and in this
respect fare no better than mere mortals (such as Sang Sapurba and Sang
Ranjuna Tapa) and animals (such as, in fables, Sang Kanchil, Mr.
Mousedeer; and Sang Tikus, Mr. Rat).</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The expression <i lang="ms">batara</i> is also
limited to the greater Hindu divinities (except when used as a royal
title), <i>e.g.</i> Batara Guru, Batara Kala, Batara Indra, Batara
Bisnu, etc. Thus the expressions <i lang="ms">sang-yang</i> and
<i lang="ms">batara</i> are fairly coincident in their
application.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5439src" href="#xd21e5439"
name="xd21e5439src">8</a> But there are a few deities of whom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>the honorific <i lang="ms">sang-yang</i> is used,
but not <i lang="ms">batara</i>, e.g. <i lang="ms">sang-yang
tunggal</i>, &lsquo;the only God,&rsquo; <i lang="ms">sang-yang
sokma</i>, etc.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thus <i lang="ms">batara</i> would seem to be
limited in use to the actual names of Hindu deities as distinct from
epithets describing those deities. &ldquo;Batara Guru&rdquo; would seem
to be an exception&mdash;the only one&mdash;to this rule, and to point
to the fact that the original meaning of <i lang="ms">guru</i> had been
lost sight of, and that the <i>expression</i> had come to be regarded
only as a proper name.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Occasionally, as is only to be expected, the Malays get
mixed in their mythology, and of this Mr. Wilkinson gives two examples,
one of the identification of Batara Guru (Shiva) with Brahma
(B&#277;rahmana), and another of the drawing of a distinction between
&ldquo;Guru&rdquo; (Shiva) and &ldquo;Mahadewa,&rdquo; which latter is
only another name for the same divinity.</p>
<p class="par">Such slips are inevitable among an illiterate people,
and should always be criticised by comparison with the original Hindu
tenets, from which these ideas may be presumed to have proceeded.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Mr. Wilkinson quotes an extraordinary genealogy
representing, <i>inter alia</i>, &ldquo;Guru as the actual father of
the Hindu Trinity,&rdquo; and also of &ldquo;Sambu&rdquo; (whom he
cannot identify), and &ldquo;S&#277;ri, who is the Hindu Sri, the
goddess of grain, and, therefore, a deity of immense importance to the
old Javanese and Malays.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On this I would only remark that Sambu (or Jambu) is the
first portion of the name almost universally ascribed to the
Crocodile-spirit by the Peninsular Malays.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5556src" href="#xd21e5556" name="xd21e5556src">9</a></p>
<p class="par">It would be beyond the scope of this work to attempt the
identification of Batara Guru (Shiva) with all the numerous
manifestations and titles attributed to him by the Malays, but the
special manifestation (of Shiva), which is called &ldquo;Kala,&rdquo;
forms an integral part of the general conception, whether among the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>Malays or Hindus, and is, therefore, deserving of
some attention.</p>
<p class="par">The Malay conception of Batara Guru seems to have been
that he had both a good and a bad side to his character. Though he was
&ldquo;Destroyer&rdquo; he was also
&ldquo;Restorer-to-life,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5599src"
href="#xd21e5599" name="xd21e5599src">10</a> and it would appear that
these two opposite manifestations of his power tended to develop into
two distinct personalities, a development which apparently was never
entirely consummated. This, however, is not the only difficulty, for on
investigating the limits of the respective spheres of influence of
Batara Guru and Kala, we find that the only sphere, which is always
admitted to be under Kala&rsquo;s influence, is the <i>intermediate</i>
zone between the respective spheres of influence of Batara Guru (as he
is called if on land, &ldquo;Si Raya&rdquo; if at sea) and a
<i>third</i> divinity, who goes by the name of &ldquo;<span lang=
"ms">&rsquo;Toh Panjang Kuku</span>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Grandsire
Long-Claws.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Now Hindu mythology, we are told, knows next to nothing
of the sea, and any such attempt as this to define the respective
boundaries of sea and land is almost certain to be due to the influence
of Malay ideas. Again, the intermediate zone is not necessarily
considered less dangerous than that of definitely evil influences. Thus
the most dangerous time for children to be abroad is sunset, the hour
when we can &ldquo;call it neither perfect day nor night&rdquo;; so too
a day of mingled rain and sunshine is regarded as fraught with peculiar
dangers from evil spirits, and it would be quite in keeping with such
ideas that the intermediate zone, whether between high and low
water-mark, or between the clearing and primeval <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>forest,
should be assigned to Kala, the Destroyer. In which case the expression
&ldquo;Grandsire Long-Claws&rdquo; might be used to signify this
special manifestation of Shiva on land, possibly through the
personality of the Tiger, just as the Crocodile-spirit appears to
represent Shiva by water.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5617src" href=
"#xd21e5617" name="xd21e5617src">11</a></p>
<p class="par">We thus reach a point of exceptional interest, for
hunting, being among the old Hindus one of the seven deadly sins, was
regarded as a low pursuit, and one which would never be indulged in by
a god. Yet I was repeatedly told when collecting charms about the
Spectre Huntsman that he was a god, and, explicitly, that he was Batara
Guru. This shows the strength of the Malay influences which had been at
work, and which had actually succeeded in corrupting the character, so
to speak, of the supreme god of this borrowed Hindu Trinity.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5622src" href="#xd21e5622" name=
"xd21e5622src">12</a></p>
<p class="par">The Batara Guru of the Sea, who by some magicians, at
all events, is identified with Si Raya (the &ldquo;Great One&rdquo;),
and, probably wrongly, with the God of Mid-currents<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5637src" href="#xd21e5637" name="xd21e5637src">13</a> (Mambang
Tali Harus), is of a much milder character than his terrestrial
namesake or compeer, and although sickness may sometimes be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>ascribed to the sea-spirit&rsquo;s wrath, it is
neither so sudden nor so fatal as the sickness ascribed to the wanton
and unprovoked malice of the Spectre Huntsman, or Spirit of the
Land.</p>
<p class="par">Fishermen and seafarers, on the other hand, obtain many
a favour from him, and even hope to make friends with him by means of
simple sacrifices and charms.</p>
<p class="par">Si Raya (or Madu-Raya) is said to have a family, his
wife&rsquo;s name being Madu-ruti, and his children &ldquo;Wa&rsquo;
Ranai,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Si K&#277;kas&rdquo; (the scratcher), all of
whom, however, have their own separate spheres of influence. The
&ldquo;Great One&rdquo; himself (Madu-Raya) rules over the sea from
low-water mark (at the river&rsquo;s mouth) out to mid-ocean; and if
his identity with &ldquo;<span lang="ms">&rsquo;Toh Rimpun

fable, and at whose foot dwells the Gigantic Crab, whose entrance into

<p class="par first">The &ldquo;Jins&rdquo; or &ldquo;Genii,&rdquo;
generally speaking, form a very extensive class of quite subordinate
divinities, godlings, or spirits, whose place in Malay mythology is
clearly due, whether directly or indirectly, to Muhammadan influences,
but who may be most conveniently treated here as affording a sort of
connecting link between gods and ghosts. There has, it would appear,
been a strong tendency on the part of the Malays to identify these
imported spirits with the spirits of their older (Hindu) religion, but
the only Genie who really rises to the level of one of the great Hindu
divinities is the Black King of the Genii (Sang Gala<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5702src" href="#xd21e5702" name="xd21e5702src">16</a> Raja, or
Sa-Raja Jin), who appears at times a manifestation of Shiva Batara
Guru, who is confounded with the destructive side of Shiva, <i>i.e.</i>
Kala. This at least would appear to be the only theory on which we
could explain the use of many of the epithets or attributes assigned to
the King of the Genii, who is at one time called &ldquo;the one and
only God&rdquo;; at another, &ldquo;B&#277;ntara (<i>i.e.</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=

beginning,&rdquo; and at another, &ldquo;the Land Demon, the

<p class="par">Altogether there are one hundred and ninety of these
(Black?) Genii&mdash;more strictly, perhaps, one hundred and
ninety-three, which coincides curiously with the number of
&ldquo;Mischiefs&rdquo; (Badi), which reside in &ldquo;all living
things.&rdquo; The resemblance, I may add, does not end here; for
though the Genii <i>may</i> do good, and the &ldquo;Badi&rdquo; do not,
both are considered able to do infinite harm to mortals, and both make
choice of the same kind of dwelling-places, such as hollows in the
hills, solitary patches of primeval forest, dead parasites on trees,
etc. etc.</p>
<p class="par">As to the origin of these Genii, one magician told me
that all &ldquo;Jins&rdquo; came from the country &ldquo;Ban
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>Ujan,&rdquo; which may possibly be Persia<a id=
"xd21e5800" name="xd21e5800"></a>;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5802src"
href="#xd21e5802" name="xd21e5802src">19</a> other magicians, however,
variously derive them from the dissolution of various parts of the
anatomy of the great snake &ldquo;Sakatimuna,&rdquo; of the
&ldquo;First Great Failure&rdquo; to make man&rsquo;s image (at the
creation of man); from the drops of blood which spirted up to heaven
when the first twins, Abel and Cain (in the Malay version Habil and
Kabil) bit their thumbs; from the big cocoa-nut monkey or baboon
(<i lang="ms">b&#277;rok b&#277;sar</i>), and so on.</p>
<p class="par">The theory already mentioned, viz. that the Black King
of the Genii gradually came to be identified with Kala, and later came
gradually to be established as a separate personality, appears to be
the only one which will satisfactorily explain the relations subsisting
between the Black and White Genii, who are on the one hand distinctly
declared to be brothers, whilst the White Genie is in another passage
declared to be Maharaja Dewa or Mahadewa, which latter is, as we have
already seen, a special name of Shiva.</p>
<p class="par">This White Genie is said to have sprung, by one account,
from the blood-drops which fell on the ground when Habil and Kabil bit
their thumbs; by another, from the irises of the snake
Sakatimuna&rsquo;s eyes (<i lang="ms">b&#277;nih mata Sakatimuna</i>),
and is sometimes confused with the White Divinity (&rsquo;Toh Mambang
Puteh), who lives in the sun.</p>
<p class="par">The name of his wife is not mentioned, as it is in the
case of the Black Genie, but the names of three of his children have
been preserved, and they are Tanjak <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96"
href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>Malim Kaya, Pari Lang (lit.
kite-like, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;winged&rdquo; Skate), and Bintang Sutan
(or Star of Sutan).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5838src" href=
"#xd21e5838" name="xd21e5838src">20</a></p>
<p class="par">On the whole, I may say that the White Genie is very
seldom mentioned in comparison with the Black Genie, and that whereas
absolutely no harm, so far as I can find out, is recorded of him, he
is, on the other hand, appealed to for protection by his
worshippers.</p>
<p class="par">A very curious subdivision of Genii into Faithful (Jin
Isl&#257;m) and Infidel (Jin Kafir) is occasionally met with, and it is
said, moreover, that Genii (it is to be hoped orthodox ones) may be
sometimes <i>bought</i> at Mecca from the &ldquo;Sheikh Jin&rdquo;
(Headman of Genii) at prices varying from $90 to $100 a piece.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5848src" href="#xd21e5848" name=
"xd21e5848src">21</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97"
name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Besides these subdivisions, certain Genii are sometimes
specifically connected with special objects or ideas. Thus there are
the Genii of the royal musical instruments (Jin N&#277;mfiri, or
L&#277;mpiri, G&#277;ndang, and Naubat), who are sometimes identified
with the Genii of the State (Jin Karaja&rsquo;an), and the Genii of the
Royal Weapons (Jin S&#277;mbuana), both of which classes of Genii are
held able to strike men dead. The only other Genie that I would here
specially mention is the Jin &#703;Afrit (sometimes called Jin Rafrit),
from whom the &ldquo;White Man&rdquo; (a designation which is often
specially used in the Peninsula as a synonym for Englishman) is
sometimes said to have sprung, but who belongs in Arabian mythology to
a higher class than the mere Genii. Before leaving the subject of
Genii, I must, however, point out the extremely common juxtaposition of
the Arabic word &ldquo;Jin&rdquo; and the Malay
&ldquo;J&#277;mbalang.&rdquo; From the frequency with which this
juxtaposition occurs, and from the fact that the two appear to be used
largely as convertible terms, we might expect to find that Jin and
J&#277;mbalang were mere synonyms, both applicable to similar classes
of spirits. The process is not quite complete, however, as although the
expression J&#277;mbalang Tunggal (the only J&#277;mbalang), is found
as well as Jin Tunggal, the higher <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98"
href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>honorific Sang Raja or Sa-Raja
is never, so far as I am aware, prefixed to the word
&ldquo;J&#277;mbalang,&rdquo; though it is frequently prefixed to
&ldquo;Jin.&rdquo; Of the other members of the Malay hierarchy who owe
their introduction to Muhammadan influences, the only ones of
importance are angels (Mala&rsquo;ikat), prophets (Nabi), and headmen
(Sheikh).</p>
<p class="par">I will take them in this order.</p>
<p class="par">Of the angels, unquestionably the most important are
Azrael (&#703;Azra&rsquo;il or &#703;Ijrail), Michael (Mika&rsquo;il),
Israfel (Israfil, Ijrafil, or Serafil), and Gabriel (Jibra&rsquo;il or
&rsquo;Jabra&rsquo;il, often corrupted into Raja Brahil). There can be
no doubt that the foregoing are meant for the names of a group of four
archangels, the name of Israfel corresponding to Abdiel, who generally
occupies the fourth place in our own angelic hierarchy.</p>
<p class="par">Their customary duties are apportioned among the four
great angels as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Azrael is, as with us, the angel of death, who
&ldquo;carries off the lives of all creatures&rdquo;; Israfel is
&ldquo;lord of all the different airs&rdquo; in our body; Michael is
the &ldquo;giver of daily bread&rdquo;; and Gabriel is a messenger or
&ldquo;bringer of news.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes, again, a White Angel (Mala&rsquo;ikat Puteh)
is mentioned, <i>e.g.</i> as being in &ldquo;charge of all things in
the jungle,&rdquo; but what his specific duties are in this connection
does not transpire.</p>
<p class="par">In an invocation addressed to the Sea-spirit, however,
we find four more such angels mentioned, all of whom hold similar
charges:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Chitar Ali is the angel&rsquo;s name, who is lord of
the whirlpool;</p>
<p class="line">Sabur Ali is the angel&rsquo;s name, who is lord of the
winds;</p>
<p class="line">Sir Ali is the angel&rsquo;s name, who is lord of the
waters of the sea;</p>
<p class="line">Putar Ali is the angel&rsquo;s name, who is lord of the
rainbow.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">No doubt the names of many more of the subordinate
angels might be collected, as we are repeatedly told that they are
forty-four in number.</p>
<p class="par">Of the prophets (Nabi) there are an indefinite number,
the title being applied to many of the more prominent characters who
figure in our own Old Testament (as well as in the Kor&#257;n), but who
would not by ourselves be considered to possess any special
qualifications for prophetic office. Among the more famous of these I
may mention (after Muhammad and his immediate compeers) the prophet
Solomon (sometimes considered&mdash;no doubt owing to his unrivalled
reputation for magical skill&mdash;as the king of the Genii, whose
assistance the hunter or trapper is continually invoking); the prophet
David, celebrated for the beauty of his voice; and the prophet Joseph,
celebrated for the beauty of his countenance. Besides these (and others
of the same type), there is a group of minor prophets whose assistance
is continually invoked in charms; these are the prophet Tap (T&#277;tap
or K&#277;tap?), &ldquo;lord of the earth;&rdquo; the prophet Khailir
(Khaithir or Khizr), &ldquo;lord of water;&rdquo; the prophet Noah,
&ldquo;lord of trees;&rdquo; and the prophet Elias, &ldquo;planter of
trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Khizr is often confounded with Elias. He discovered and
drank of the fountain of life (whence his connection with water), and
will consequently not die till the last trump.</p>
<p class="par">Next to the prophets comes the &ldquo;Sultan&rdquo;
(Sultan), or &ldquo;King&rdquo; (Malik), both of which Arabic titles,
however, are somewhat rarely used by Malay magicians. Still we find
such expressions as Sa-Raja (Sang-Raja?) Malik (King of Kings) applied
to Batara Guru. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100"
name="pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Next to these royal honorifics comes the title of
&ldquo;Headman&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sheikh.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There are, it is usually stated, four of these Sheikhs
who are &ldquo;penned&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">di-kandang</i>) in the Four
Corners of the Earth respectively, and whose names are &#703;Abdul
Kadir, &#703;Abdul Muri, a third whose name is not mentioned, and
&#703;Abdul &#703;Ali.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5933src" href=
"#xd21e5933" name="xd21e5933src">22</a></p>
<p class="par">Sometimes they are called &ldquo;Sheikh
&#703;Alam&rdquo; (or Si Putar &#703;Alam), and are each said to reside
&ldquo;within a ring-fence of white iron.&rdquo; Hence we obtain a
perfectly intelligible meaning for the expression, &ldquo;<i>Ask pardon
of the Four Corners of the World</i>,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> of the Sheikhs
who reside therein, though the phrase sounds ridiculous enough without
such explanation.</p>
<p class="par">The only other Arabic title which is perhaps worth
noticing here<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5946src" href="#xd21e5946"
name="xd21e5946src">23</a> is that of &ldquo;Priest&rdquo; (Im&#257;m),
which we find somewhat curiously used in an invocation addressed to the
sea-spirit. &ldquo;Im&#257;m An Jalil is the name of the
&lsquo;<i>Priest of the Sea</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the invocation addressed to the Sea-spirit we find
the expression:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Jungle-chief of the World is the name of the Old
Man of the Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There can, however, be little doubt that this &ldquo;Old
Man of the Sea&rdquo; is a mere synonym for Batara Guru.</p>
<p class="par">A set of expressions to which special reference should
perhaps be made consists of the titles used by the wild jungle tribes
(Sakais), the use of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>is important as confirming the
principle that the &ldquo;Autochthones&rdquo; are more influential with
the spirits residing in their land than any later arrivals can be,
whatever skill the latter may have acquired in the magic arts of the
country from whence they came.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, Munshi, in his
Autobiography, has an interesting passage on the beliefs of the Malays
on the subject of spirits and demons, beliefs which are much more
deeply-rooted than is generally supposed. He does not, however,
differentiate between national customs and beliefs, and those which
have come in with the Muhammadan religion. And indeed it is not easy to
do so. Here, everything is classed under the generic term <i lang=
"ms">sheitan</i>, which is Arabic, and we find the <i lang=

fall between the rocks.</p>
<p class="par">The Hantu Longgak<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6463src"

(Demon of Wild-beast-tracks), the Hantu-hantuan (Echo-spirits), and I
think the Hantu Bakal, are all spirits of the jungle, but are perhaps
somewhat less localised than the large class of spirits (such as the
Malacca-cane, <i lang="ms">gharu</i>, gutta, and camphor-tree spirits)
which are specially associated with particular trees.</p>
<p class="par">The Hantu B&rsquo;rok is the Baboon Demon (the
B&rsquo;rok being what is generally called the &ldquo;cocoa-nut
monkey,&rdquo; a sort of big baboon); it is sometimes supposed to take
possession of dancers, and enable them, whilst unconscious, to perform
wonderful climbing feats.</p>
<p class="par">The Hantu B&#277;lian, according to many Selangor
Malays, is a tiger-spirit which takes the form of a bird. This bird is
said to be not unlike the raquet-tailed king-crow (<i lang=

it plucks out the tiger&rsquo;s fur and swallows it, never allowing it

B&#277;diadari) or P&#277;ri (fairies and elves), which are of foreign
origin, and the &ldquo;Orang Bunyian,&rdquo; a class of Malay spirits
about whom very little seems known. The latter appear to be a race of
good fairies, who are so simple-minded that they can be very easily
cheated. Thus it is always said of them, that whenever they come into a
hamlet, as they may occasionally do, to buy anything, they always pay
without bargaining whatever price is asked, however exorbitant it may
be. I have been told of their existence at Kapar village (near Klang in
Selangor), at Jugra, where it was said they might formerly be heard
paddling their boats upon the river when no boat was visible, and
elsewhere.</p>
<p class="par">Besides these there are several kinds of bloodsucking

Crawfurd, <i>Hist. of the Ind. Archipelago</i>, vol. ii. p. 219.
&ldquo;From some of the usual epithets bestowed upon Siwa by the pagan
Javanese, and still familiar to their posterity, the pre-eminence of
this deity is clearly demonstrated.... He is the same personage who
acts so distinguished a part in the machinery of Malayan and Javanese
romances, under the appellation of <i lang="ms">Guru</i>, or the
instructor, prefixing to it the word <i lang="ms">Batara</i>, a
corruption of <i lang="ms">Avatara</i>, both in sense and orthography,
for with the Indian islanders that word is not used as with the genuine
Hindus, to express the incarnation of a god, but as an appellation
expressing any deity; nay, as if conferring an apotheosis upon their
princes, it has been sometimes prefixed to the names of some of the
most celebrated of their ancient kings. When Siwa appears in this
character, in the romances of the Indian islanders, he is painted as a
powerful, mischievous, and malignant tyrant&mdash;a description
sufficiently consonant to his character of Destroyer in the Hindu
triad&rdquo;; and, again, &ldquo;<i lang="ms">ywang</i> is a Javanese
word used in the same sense as <i lang="ms">batara</i>.... Usually the
obsolete relative pronoun <i lang="ms">sang</i>, which has the sense,
in this case, of a definite article, is placed before it. Thus <i lang=

Mr. Wilkinson&rsquo;s explanation of this last expression be taken as
correct. And in any case its use in combination with <i lang=

applied to the greater deities. It is also, however, used, like
<i lang="ms">sang</i>, of inferior deities and even of animals
(<i>e.g.</i> in a &ldquo;Spectre Huntsman&rdquo; charm) we find
&ldquo;<i lang="ms">Lansat, sa-raja anjing</i>, etc.&rdquo; <i lang=
"ms">Dewa</i> is used indiscriminately (occasionally in conjunction
with <i lang="ms">mambang</i>) both of the greater and lesser
divinities. Thus we not unfrequently find such expressions as <i lang=
"ms">Dewa Bisnu</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Vishnu), <i lang="ms">dewa
mambang</i>, <i lang="ms">dewa dan mambang</i>, etc.; and we are

to be similarly used, not only of greater (<i>vide</i> App. <a href=

Harus,&rdquo; god of mid-currents, has even been explained as referring
to Batara Guru (Shiva). This, however, is no doubt an instance of
confusion, as it generally appears to be used with the
&ldquo;colour&rdquo; attributes (<i>e.g.</i> <i lang="ms">M. puteh</i>,
White; <i lang="ms">M. hitam</i>, Black; <i lang="ms">M. kuning</i>,
Yellow) usually assigned to the inferior divinities; and, moreover, in
an invocation addressed to the sea-spirit, the &ldquo;god of
mid-currents&rdquo; is requested to forward a message to Dato&rsquo;
Rimpun &#703;Alam, which appears to be merely another name for Batara
Guru, the reason given for the preferment of this request being that he
is in the habit of &ldquo;visiting the Heart of the Seas&rdquo; in
which &rsquo;Toh Rimpun &#703;Alam dwells (the title of the latter
being perhaps taken from the <i>tree</i>, Pauh Janggi).&nbsp;<a class=

<i>supra</i>. Sambu (Sambhu, the Auspicious One) is merely another name
for Shiva (rarely of Brahma), and its application to the
crocodile-spirit would appear to indicate that this latter was,
formerly, at least, regarded as an embodiment of that supreme
god&rsquo;s manifestation as a water-god. It is worth while to compare
this with the expression &ldquo;<span lang="ms">&rsquo;Toh Panjang

afford proof sufficient, if any were needed, of the former prevalence

are altered or varied in sense. <i lang="ms">Tapas</i>, &lsquo;ascetic

descent or incarnation of a deity, is used as an appellative for any of
the principal Hindu deities. Combined with <i lang="ms">guru</i>, also
Sanskrit, it is the most current name of the chief god of the Hindus,
worshipped by the Indian islanders, supposed to have been Vishnu, or
the preserving power. It may be translated &ldquo;the spiritual guide

following account of Genii (printed in the <i>Selangor Journal</i>,
vol. i. No. 7, p. 102) was given me by a Mecca pilgrim or
&ldquo;Haji.&rdquo; This man was a native of Java who had spent several
years in the Malay Peninsula, and as Mecca is the goal of the
pilgrimage to all good Muhammadans alike, it is important to know
something of the ideas which are there disseminated, and with which the
Malay pilgrim would be likely to come in contact. &ldquo;In the unseen
world the place of first importance must be accorded, on account of
their immense numbers, to the &lsquo;Jins&rsquo; (the
&lsquo;Genii&rsquo; of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The Javanese, drawing a slightly
stronger line of distinction (than that of good and bad genii in the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>), call these two (separate) classes the Jin Islam
and the Jin Kafir, or the Faithful and the Infidel. Of these two
classes, the former shrink from whatever is unclean, and the latter
only will approach the Chinese, to whom the Jin Islam manifests the
strongest repugnance. The good genii are perfectly formed in the
fashion of a man, but are, of course, impalpable as air, though they
have a voice like mortals. They live in a mosque of their own, which
they never leave, and where they offer up unceasing prayers. This
mosque is built of stone, and stands beside a lake called &lsquo;Kolam
Yamani&rsquo;; into this lake the whole of the waters from the
neighbouring country drain, and the overflow runs down to the sea. In
this lake the good genii bathe, and if any wicked or childless mortals
bathe in it they carry them off and detain them in the mosque until
they (the mortals) have shown proof of their reformed character by
continuing for a long while without committing a wrong action, when
they are sent back in safety to their native land. I should add that
the Jin Islam exact tribute from the unfaithful&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
Chinamen&mdash;and if they do not receive their due, they will steal it
and give it to a son of Islam. [They may be bought from the
&ldquo;Sheikh Jin&rdquo; at Mecca for prices varying from $90 to $100
each.]</p>

atmosphere from earth to sky. Like the good Genii, they cannot die
before the great day of judgment, but (unlike them) they are dumb.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;Great as their numbers are they are
continually increasing, as they are suffered by God to get children
after their kind. They are imps of mischief, and their whole time is
spent in works of malice. Sometimes when there has been a long drought
and a heavy shower of rain is poured down upon the earth by the angels
at the bidding of God to cool the parched verdure, they will assemble
their legions, bringing with them invisible cocoa-nut shells, one for
each drop of rain. In these they catch each rain-drop as it falls, and
herbs and trees alike wither for lack of moisture. Then the angels
being wroth, cast thunderbolts upon them out of heaven, and these
malicious elves take shelter in tall trees, which the thunderbolts
blast in their fall. At another time they will climb one upon the
other&rsquo;s shoulders until they reach the sky, when the topmost elf
kicks a neighbouring angel, and then they all fall together with a

snares and rope-traps, and as the most obvious way in which they could
be &ldquo;interfered&rdquo; with would be by untying or loosening their
knots, the connection between the name of this spirit and the Malay
<i lang="ms">rungkei</i> to unloose or undo, is sufficiently obvious.
The name, therefore, would appear to mean the &ldquo;Untying&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Loosening Demon,&rdquo; naturally a most vexatious spirit to
have anywhere near your snares or nooses.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

weather&mdash;a power of which Malay magic incantations still preserve
remarkable traces.</p>
<p class="par">Thus when the wind fails and the sails of a boat are

CHARMS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The chief features of the Bird-lore of the
Peninsular Malays, which, as will appear in the course of this chapter,
is strongly tinged with animism, have been thus described by Sir
William Maxwell:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ideas of various characters are associated by
Malays with birds of different kinds, and many of their favourite
similes are furnished by the feathered world. The peacock strutting in
the jungle, the argus pheasant calling on the mountain peak, the hoot
of the owl, and the cry of the night-jar, have all suggested
comparisons of various kinds, which are embodied in the proverbs of the
people.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6791src" href="#xd21e6791" name=
"xd21e6791src">10</a> The Malay <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110"
href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>is a keen observer of nature,
and his illustrations, drawn from such sources, are generally just and
often poetical.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The supernatural bird <i lang="ms">Gerda</i>
(Garuda, the eagle of Vishnu), who figures frequently in Malay
romances, is dimly known to the Malay peasant. If, during the day, the
sun is suddenly overcast by clouds and shadow succeeds to brilliancy,
the P&ecirc;rak Malay will say &ldquo;<i lang="ms">Gerda</i> is
spreading out his wings to dry.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6897src" href="#xd21e6897" name="xd21e6897src">11</a> Tales are
told, too, of other fabulous birds<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6901src"
href="#xd21e6901" name="xd21e6901src">12</a>&mdash;the <i lang=
"ms">jintayu</i>, which is never seen, though its note is heard, and
which announces the approach of rain;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6935src" href="#xd21e6935" name="xd21e6935src">13</a> and the
<i lang="ms">chandrawasi</i>, which has no feet. The <i lang=
"ms">chandrawasi</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span>lives in the air, and is constantly on the
wing, never descending to earth or alighting on a tree. Its young even
are produced without the necessity of touching the earth. The egg is
allowed to drop, and as it nears the earth it bursts, and the young
bird appears fully developed. The note of the <i lang=
"ms">chandrawasi</i> may often be heard at night, but never by day, and
it is lucky, say the Malays, to halt at a spot where it is heard
calling.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is an allusion to this bird in a common
<i lang="ms">pantun</i>&mdash;a kind of erotic stanza very popular
among the Malays:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;<i lang="ms">Chandrawasi burong sakti,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i lang="ms">Sangat berkurong didalam awan.</i></p>
<p class="line"><i lang="ms">Gonda gulana didalam hati,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i lang="ms">Sahari tidak memandang tuan.</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6982src" href="#xd21e6982" name=
"xd21e6982src">14</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Nocturnal birds are generally considered
ill-omened all over the world, and popular superstition among the
Malays fosters a prejudice against one species of owl. If it happens to
alight and hoot near a house, the inhabitants say significantly that
there will soon be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112"
name="pb112">112</a>]</span>&lsquo;tearing of cloth&rsquo; (<i lang=
"ms">koyah kapan</i>) for a shroud. This does not apply to the small
owl called <i lang="ms">punggok</i>, which, as soon as the moon rises,
may often be heard to emit a soft plaintive note. The note of the
<i lang="ms">punggok</i> is admired by the Malays, who suppose it to be
sighing for the moon, and find in it an apt simile for a desponding
lover.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">baberek</i> or <i lang=
"ms">birik-birik</i>, another nocturnal bird, is a harbinger of
misfortune. This bird is said to fly in flocks at night; it has a
peculiar note, and a passing flock makes a good deal of noise. If these
birds are heard passing, the P&ecirc;rak peasant brings out a <i lang=
"ms">s&#277;ngkalan</i> (a wooden platter on which spices are ground),
and beats it with a knife, or other domestic utensil, calling out as he
does so: &ldquo;<i lang="ms">Nenek, bawa hati-nia</i>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Great-grandfather, bring us their hearts&rdquo;). This is an
allusion to the belief that the bird <i lang="ms">baberek</i> flies in
the train of the Spectre Huntsman (<i lang="ms">hantu pemburu</i>), who
roams Malay forests with several ghostly dogs, and whose appearance is
the forerunner of disease or death. &ldquo;Bring us their hearts&rdquo;
is a mode of asking for some of his game, and it is hoped that the
request will delude the <i lang="ms">hantu pemburu</i> into the belief
that the applicants are <i lang="ms">ra&#703;iyat</i>, or followers of
his, and that he will, therefore, spare the household.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">baberek</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7107src" href="#xd21e7107" name="xd21e7107src">15</a> which
flies with the wild hunt, bears a striking resemblance to the white
owl, <i lang="ms">Totosel</i>, the nun who broke her vow, and now
mingles her &ldquo;tutu&rdquo; with the &ldquo;holloa&rdquo; of the
Wild Huntsman of the Harz.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7122src" href=
"#xd21e7122" name="xd21e7122src">16</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">&ldquo;The legend of the Spectre Huntsman is thus told
by the P&ecirc;rak Malays:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In former days, at Katapang, in Sumatra, there
lived a man whose wife, during her pregnancy, was seized with a violent
longing for the meat of the <i lang="ms">pelandok</i> (mouse-deer). But
it was no ordinary <i lang="ms">pelandok</i> that she wanted. She
insisted that it should be a doe, big with male offspring, and she bade
her husband go and seek in the jungle for what she wanted. The man took
his weapons and dogs and started, but his quest was fruitless, for he
had misunderstood his wife&rsquo;s injunctions, and what he sought was
a <i>buck pelandok</i>, big with male offspring, an unheard-of prodigy.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Day and night he hunted, slaying innumerable
mouse-deer, which he threw away on finding that they did not fulfil the
conditions required.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He had sworn a solemn oath on leaving home that
he would not return unsuccessful, so he became a regular denizen of the
forest, eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the animals which he
slew, and pursuing night and day his fruitless search. At length he
said to himself: &lsquo;I have hunted the whole earth over without
finding what I want; it is now time to try the firmament.&rsquo; So he
holloa&rsquo;d on his dogs through the sky, while he walked below on
the earth looking up at them, and after a long time, the hunt still
being unsuccessful, the back of his head, from constantly gazing
upwards, became fixed to his back, and he was no longer able to look
down at the earth. One day a leaf from the tree called <i lang="ms">Si
Limbak</i> fell on his throat and took root there, and a straight shoot
grew upwards in front of his face.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7233src"
href="#xd21e7233" name="xd21e7233src">19</a> In this state he still
hunts through Malay forests, urging on his dogs as they hunt through
the sky, with his gaze evermore turned upwards.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">&ldquo;His wife, whom he left behind when he started on
the fatal chase, was delivered in due time of two children&mdash;a boy
and a girl. When they were old enough to play with other children, it
chanced one day that the boy quarrelled with the child of a neighbour
with whom he was playing. The latter reproached him with his
father&rsquo;s fate, of which the child had hitherto <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>been
ignorant, saying: &lsquo;Thou art like thy father, who has become an
evil spirit, ranging the forests day and night, and eating and drinking
no man knows how. Get thee to thy father.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then the boy ran crying to his mother and related
what had been said to him. &lsquo;Do not cry,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;it is true, alas! that thy father has become a spirit of
evil.&rsquo; On this the boy cried all the more, and begged to be
allowed to join his father. His mother yielded at last to his
entreaties, and told him the name of his father and the names of the
dogs. He might be known, she said, by his habit of gazing fixedly at
the sky and by his four weapons&mdash;a blow-pipe (<i lang=
"ms">sumpitan</i>), a spear, a <i lang="ms">kris</i>, and a sword
(<i lang="ms">klewang</i>). &lsquo;And,&rsquo; added she, &lsquo;when
thou hearest the hunt approaching, call upon him and the dogs by name,
and repeat thy own name and mine, so that he may know thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The boy entered the forest, and, after he had
walked some way, met an old man who asked him where he was going.
&lsquo;I go to join my father,&rsquo; said the lad. &lsquo;If thou
findest him,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;ask him where he has put
my chisel which he has borrowed from me.&rsquo; This the boy promised
to do, and continued his journey. After he had gone a long way he heard
sounds like those made by people engaged in hunting. As they
approached, he repeated the names which his mother had told him, and
immediately found himself face to face with his father. The hunter
demanded of him who he was, and the child repeated all that his mother
had told him, not forgetting the message of the old man about the
chisel. Then the hunter said: &lsquo;Truly thou art my son. As for the

afflicted mankind, and many are those whom he has destroyed. Before
dismissing his son, he desired him to warn all his kindred never to use
bamboo for making steps for a house, and never to hang clothes to dry
from poles stuck in between the joists supporting the floor, and thus
jutting out at right angles with a house, &lsquo;lest,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;I should strike against such poles as I walk along.

ascribed to Katapang<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7467src" href=

strikingly resembles the European legends of the Wild Huntsman, whose
shouts the trembling peasants hear above the storm. It is, no doubt, of
Aryan origin, and, coming to the Peninsula from Sumatra, seems to
corroborate existing evidence tending to show that it is partly through
Sumatra that the Peninsula has received Aryan myths and Indian
phraseology. A superstitious prejudice against the use of bamboo in
making a step-ladder for a Malay house and against drying clothes
outside a house on poles stuck into the framework, exists in full force
among the P&ecirc;rak Malays.</p>

<p class="par">To the information contained in the foregoing passage I
would add the following observations:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Charms for neutralising the power of the Spectre
Huntsman are by no means uncommon, and though they almost invariably
differ in unimportant details, such as the names of his dogs and
weapons, they still bear strong and unmistakable family likeness. Still
there are some versions which contain important divergencies (two or
three of these versions will be found in the Appendix), and it will
only be after the diligent collation and compilation of a great many
versions that the real germ or nucleus of the myth as known to the
Malays will be clearly apparent.</p>
<p class="par">One of the charms given in the Appendix evidently
alludes to a different version of the story; the lines which contain
the allusion being as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I know your origin, O man of penance,</p>
<p class="line">Whose dwelling was upon the hill of Mount Ophir,</p>
<p class="line">[You sprang] from a son of the Prophet Joseph who was
wroth with his mother,</p>
<p class="line">Because she would eat the hearts of the birds of
Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Yet even here, if we except the obvious
interpolation of the reference to the &ldquo;son of the Prophet
Joseph,&rdquo; the task of reconciling the conflicting versions may be
easier than would appear at first sight.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7524src" href="#xd21e7524" name="xd21e7524src">25</a></p>
<p class="par">A still more curious deviation occurs in another
version,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7534src" href="#xd21e7534" name=
"xd21e7534src">26</a> where the Spectre Huntsman&rsquo;s poniard and
<i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i> are declared to be the insignia of the
great Spirit-King Rama. The passage is as follows:&mdash; <span class=

<p class="line">The insignia of the Demon Rama.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">That it is his <i>weapons</i> which the Spectre

</div>
<p class="par first">This reference to Rama opens up a long vista of
possibilities, but for the present it will be sufficient to remark that
the Spectre Huntsman himself is almost universally declared by the
Malays to be the King of the Land-folk (<i lang="ms">Raja orang
darat</i>). It is on account of this kingship that his weapons receive
distinguishing titles such as are given to royal weapons. This, too, is
the reason that he is so much more dreaded by Malays than ordinary
spirits of evil; his mere touch being considered sufficient to kill, by
the exercise of that divine power which all Malay Rajas are held to
possess.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7585src" href="#xd21e7585" name=

<p class="par">&ldquo;From Mr. W. E. Maxwell, H.M. Assistant Resident,
of L&acirc;rut, I hear that the Malays have a strange legend connected
with one of the large Hornbills; but which species I was not able to
find out. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;A Malay, in order to be revenged on his
mother-in-law (why, the legend does not relate), shouldered his axe and
made his way to the poor woman&rsquo;s house, and began to cut through
the posts which supported it. After a few steady chops the whole
edifice came tumbling down, and he greeted its fall with a peal of
laughter. To punish him for his unnatural conduct he was turned into a
bird, and the <i lang="ms">tebang mentuah</i> (literally, He who
chopped down his mother-in-law) may often be heard in the jungle
uttering a series of sharp sounds like the chop of an axe on timber,
followed by Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

ch&#277;roh</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e7638src" href="#xd21e7638"
name="xd21e7638src">30</a>) takes its name from the word applied to the
second stage in the operation of husking rice. Malay women husk rice by
pounding it in a mortar with a wooden pestle. The husked grain is then
commonly winnowed in a sieve, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122"
href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>the unhusked rice (<i lang=
"ms">antah</i>) which remains has to be separated from the husked rice
and pounded over again. The second process, which is called <i lang=
"ms">ck&#277;roh</i>, is that from which the night-jar derives its
name, the quick fancy of the Malay hearing in the note of the bird the
slow measured stroke of a pestle (<i lang="ms">antan</i>) descending in
a mortar (<i lang="ms">l&#277;song</i>). This is possibly the
foundation of the legend that the Night-jar is a woman who, while
engaged in husking rice by moonlight, was turned into a bird in
consequence of a quarrel with her mother. Another name for the
night-jar is <i lang="ms">burong chempak</i>.</p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="ms">Burong s&#277;pah putri</i>

explanation of its name: once upon a time the Owl (<i lang=

(P&#365;tri Bulan) and asked her to marry him. She promised to do so,
if he would allow her first to finish her quid of betel undisturbed;
but before finishing it she threw it down to the earth, where it took
the form of the small bird in question. The Princess then requested the
Owl to make search for it, but as, of course, he was unable to find it,
the proposed match fell through. This is the reason why the Owl, to
quote the Malay proverb, &ldquo;sighs longingly to the Moon,&rdquo; and

<p class="par">The &ldquo;Luck-bird&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">Burong

builds a very small white nest, which if found and placed in a rice-bin

owner. As, however, the nest is built on branches in places difficult
of access it is but rarely found, and Malays will give $10 for a
genuine specimen, while sellers are known to ask as much as $25.</p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="ms">Ruwak-ruwak</i> is a kind of Heron

<p class="par"><i lang="ms">Tukang</i> is the name given in Kedah to a

his expeditions to the forest, where he was engaged in clearing the
ground for a rice-plantation. Her parents, however, persuaded her to
stay at home; first until the trees were felled, then until the fallen
timber had been burnt off, then till the rice had been planted, and
then again till it was cut. When, however, they attempted to put her
off yet once more, until the rice should be trodden out, she could bear
it no longer, and taking off her bracelets and earrings, which she left
behind the door, and placing her little sister in the swinging-cot, she
changed herself into a ground-dove and flew away to the clearing. [She
retained her necklace, however, and this accounts for the speckled
marks on this dove&rsquo;s neck.] On arriving at the spot where her
parents were engaged at work, she alighted on a dead tree stump
(<i lang="ms">changgong</i>), and called out thrice to her mother,
&lsquo;Mother, mother, I have left my earrings and bracelets behind the
door, and have put my little sister in the swing.&rsquo; Her mother,
amazed at these words, hastened home, and found her daughter gone. She
then returned to the bird, which repeated the same words as before,
this time, however, concluding with the coo of a dove. In vain the
distressed parents endeavoured to recapture her, by cutting down the
tree on which she had perched; before <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

polishing sheaths and scabbards. When an infant keeps crying, one of
the parents takes the weaver-bird&rsquo;s nest, reduces it to ashes,
and fumigates the child by thrice moving it round in a circle over the
smoke. Whilst doing so, the parent either stands up with the right toe
resting upon the toe of the left foot, or else squats <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>upon
the left heel, bending the right knee, and saying, &lsquo;As the
weaver-bird&rsquo;s young in its nest, so rest and weep not&rsquo;
(<i lang="ms">Bagimana anak t&#277;mpua dalam sarang-nya, bagitu-lah
&rsquo;kau diam jangan m&#277;nangis</i>). To the above I may add that
besides the ordinary bottle-shaped nest, the weaver-birds also
occasionally make a hood-shaped, or rather a helmet-shaped nest, which
is alleged by the Malays to be the male bird&rsquo;s
&lsquo;swing&rsquo; (<i lang="ms">buayan</i>). This &lsquo;swing&rsquo;
resembles the upper half of an ordinary bottle-shaped nest, with a
perch across it, which latter is also woven of grass. On the walls of
the swing, just over each end of the perch, is a small daub of clay.
The Malays allege that the male bird swings in it while the hen bird is
sitting, and that the young too &lsquo;take the air&rsquo; in it as
soon as they are able to fly so far. Into the two daubs of mud over the
perch the male bird (say the Malays) sticks fire-flies to give itself
light at night.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The King crow<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7935src"
href="#xd21e7935" name="xd21e7935src">38</a> is called by the Malays
the Slave of the Monkeys (<i lang="ms">Burong hamba kra</i>). It is a
pretty, active, noisy little bird, incessantly flying about with its
two long racquet-shaped tail feathers fluttering after it. They say
that when it has both of these feathers it has paid off its debt and is
free, but when it is either destitute of these appendages, or has only
one, it is still in bondage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Gray Sea-eagle<a class="noteref" id=

Shell-fish,&rsquo; and its office is to give warning by screaming to
the shell-fish of the changes of the tide, so that they may regulate
their movements, and those species which crawl about on the mud at low
water may know when to take refuge <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"
href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>in the trees and escape the
rising tide, or when the tide is falling, that they may know when to
descend to look for food.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">Burong d&#277;mam</i>, or
&lsquo;Fever bird,&rsquo; is so called from its loud, tremulous note,
and the Malays say that the female bird calls in its fever-stricken
voice to its mate to go and find food, because it has fever so badly
that it cannot go itself. This bird is probably one of the large green
barbets. The note is often heard, and doubtless the bird has been
collected, but it is one thing shooting a bird and another identifying
it as the producer of a certain note.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Another bird, the White-breasted Water-hen, a
frequenter of the edges of reedy pools and the marshy banks of streams,
is reputed to build a nest on the ground which has the property of
rendering any one invisible who puts it on his head. The prevailing
idea among the Malays is that the proper and legitimate use to put it
to is to steal money and other species of property.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The next few notes on Malay bird-lore were collected by
the writer in Selangor:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">The Toucan or small Hornbill (<i lang=
"ms">&#276;nggang</i>) was metamorphosed from a man who, in conjunction
with a companion, broke into the house of an old man living by himself
in the jungle, and slew him for the sake of his wealth. When life was
extinct they threw a sheet over the body, and proceeded to ransack the
house, throwing the loot into a second sheet close to the corpse. Day
was about to dawn, when a false alarm induced them to make a hurried
departure, so that they picked up the sheet with their loot and made
off with it, carrying it slung hastily upon a pole between them. As
they proceeded on their way day commenced <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>gradually to dawn,
and the man behind noticing something unexpected about the bundle, and
divining the cause, called out to his companion &ldquo;<i lang=
"ms">Orang!</i>&rdquo; (pr. <i>o rang</i>) &ldquo;The man!&rdquo; His
companion, misunderstanding his exclamation, thought he meant that they
were pursued by &ldquo;<i>a</i> man,&rdquo; and only went all the
faster, until, on hearing his comrade repeat the cry a second and a
third time, he turned round, and there saw the feet of the man he had
murdered protruding from the sheet, a sight which startled him to such
a degree that he turned into a bird upon the spot, and flew away into a
tree, repeating as he went the fatal cry of &ldquo;O&rsquo;Rang!
&rsquo;Rang!&rdquo; which had caused the transformation. And to this
day, whenever the Malay hears among the tree-tops the cry of
&ldquo;&rsquo;Rang! &rsquo;rang!&rdquo; he knows that he is listening
to the cry of the murderer.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7982src" href=

and could never do enough to show their mutual friendship. One day,
however, the argus-pheasant, who was then dressed somewhat dowdily,
suggested that his friend the crow should show his skill with the brush
by decorating his (the argus-pheasant&rsquo;s) feathers. To this the
crow agreed, on condition, however, that the arrangement should be
mutual. The argus-pheasant agreed to this, and the crow forthwith set
to work, and so surpassed himself that the argus-pheasant became, as it
is now, one of the most beautiful birds in the world. When the
crow&rsquo;s task was done, however, the argus-pheasant <span class=

excusing himself on the plea that the day of judgment was too near at
hand. Hence a fierce quarrel ensued, at the end of which the

him coal-black.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8002src" href="#xd21e8002"

<p class="par">About the big Kingfisher (<i lang="ms">P&#277;kaka</i>)
an amusing parallel to the fable of the Fox and the Crow is related. It
is said that this kingfisher once caught a fish, and flew to a low
branch just overhanging the water to devour it. The fish, seeking for a
means to save his life, decided to try the effect of a speech, and
accordingly addressed his captor in the following verses, judiciously
designed to appeal at once to her vanity and compassion:&mdash;</p>

<h5 class="main"><i>Fowling Ceremonies</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ideas of sympathetic magic run very strongly
through all ceremonies connected with the taking of wild birds, such
for instance as jungle-fowl or pigeon.</p>
<p class="par">The commonest method of snaring jungle-fowl is to take a
line (called <i lang="ms">rachik</i>), with a great number of fine
nooses attached to it, and set it so as to form a complete circle,
enclosing an open space in the forest. You must bring a decoy-bird with
you, and the instructions which I collected say that you should on
arriving enter the circle, <i>holding the bird like a fighting
cock</i>, and repeat these lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ho, Si Lanang, Si T&#277;mpawi,</p>
<p class="line">Come and let us play at cock-fighting</p>
<p class="line">On the border-line between the primary and secondary
forest-growth.</p>
<p class="line">Your cock, Grandsire, is <i>spurred with steel</i>.</p>
<p class="line">Mine is but <i>spurred with bamboo</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Here deposit the bird upon the ground. The
challenge of the decoy-bird will then attract the jungle-fowl from all
directions, and as they try to enter the circle (in order to reach the
decoy), they will entangle themselves in the nooses.</p>
<p class="par">As often as you succeed, however, in catching one, you
must be careful to cast the &ldquo;mischief&rdquo; out of it, using the
same form of words as is used to drive the &ldquo;mischief&rdquo; out
of the carcase of the deer.</p>
<p class="par">The method of catching wild pigeon is much more
elaborate, and brings the animistic ideas of the Malays into strong
relief, the &ldquo;souls&rdquo; of the wild pigeon being repeatedly
referred to.</p>
<p class="par"></p>

</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">First you build a small sugar-loaf (conical) hut (called
<i lang="ms">bumbun</i>) in a carefully selected spot in the jungle.
This hut may be from four to five feet high, is strongly built of
stakes converging to a point at the top, and is thickly thatched with
leaves and branches. The reason for making it strong is that there is
always an off-chance that you may receive a visit from a tiger. At the
back of the hut you must leave a small square opening (it can hardly be
dignified with the name of a door), about two feet high and with a flap
to it, through which you can creep into the hut on your hands and
knees. [I may remark, parenthetically, that you will find the hut very
damp, very dark, and very full of mosquitoes, and that if you are wise
you will take with you a small stock of cigarettes.] In front of the
hut, that is to say, on the side away from the door, if you want to
proceed in the orthodox way, you will have to clear a small rectangular
space, and put up round it on three sides (right, left, and front
opposite the hut) a low railing consisting of a single bar about 18
inches from the ground. This is to rail off what is called &ldquo;King
Solomon&rsquo;s Palace-yard,&rdquo; and will also be useful from a
practical point of view, as it will serve as a perch for your
&ldquo;decoy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8088src" href=
"#xd21e8088" name="xd21e8088src">44</a></p>
<p class="par">The instructions proceed as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Before entering the hut the wizard must go through what
is called the &ldquo;Neutralising Rice-paste&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>) ceremony,
first in the centre of the enclosed space, and then in each corner
successively, beating each of the forked sticks (uprights) at the
corners with a bunch of leaves. He must then take the decoy-tube, and
after reciting the appropriate charm, sound a long-drawn note in each
corner successively, and then insert the mouth-end of it into the hut
through a hole in the thatch, supporting the heavy outer end upon a
forked upright stick. Then entering the hut, he slips the noose at the
end of the decoy-bird&rsquo;s rod on to the decoy-bird&rsquo;s feet,
and pushing the bird out through the front door of the hut, makes it
flutter on to one of the horizontal rods, where it will sit, if well
trained, and call its companions. After a time the decoy-bird&rsquo;s
challenge is met by first one and then many counter challenges, then
the wild pigeon approach, there is a great fluttering of wings, and
presently one of the first arrivals flies down and commences to walk
round and round the hut. Then the wizard awaits his opportunity, and as
the pigeon passes in front of the door he pushes out one of the rods
with a noose at the end, slips the noose over the bird&rsquo;s neck or
feet, and drags it into the hut.</p>
<p class="par">The hut must be used, if possible, before the leaves
with which it is thatched have faded, as the wild pigeon are less
likely to be suspicious of the hut when its thatch is green.</p>
<p class="par">In the way just described any number of pigeon can be
taken, a bag of twenty or thirty being a fair average for a day&rsquo;s
work under favourable conditions.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;call&rdquo; will occasionally, for some
unexplained reason, attract to the spot wild animals such as deer
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>(especially mouse-deer) and tigers. Is it not
possible that the story of the lute of Orpheus may have had its origin
in some old hunting custom of the kind?</p>

Prince&mdash;why so called, it is hard to say, but most likely the name
is used in allusion to the wizard who is concealed inside it. The name
given to the calling-tube itself is more appropriate, as it is called
&ldquo;Prince Distraction&rdquo; (Raja Gila), this name of course being
an allusion to the extraordinary fascination which it evidently
exercises on the pigeon. Then the decoy (or rather, perhaps, the rod to
which it is linked) is called P&#365;tri P&#277;monggo&rsquo;, or the
Squatting Princess. Next to these come three Princesses which prove to
be merely the representatives of three important species of wild
pigeon. Their names, though variously given, are perhaps most commonly
known as Princess &ldquo;Kapor,&rdquo; Princess &ldquo;Sarap,&rdquo;
and Princess &ldquo;Puding.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Finally, even the rod used for ensnaring the pigeon has
its own special name, Si Raja Nyila (Prince Invitation).</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;King Solomon&rsquo;s necklaces&rdquo; and armlets
are of course the nooses with which they are to be snared, and which
will catch them either by the neck or by the leg.</p>
<p class="par">The Princesses are invited to enter a gorgeous
palace:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=

CHARMS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The first operation in building is the selection
of the site. This is determined by an elaborate code of rules which
make the choice depend&mdash;firstly, upon the nature of the soil with
respect to colour, taste, and smell; secondly, upon the formation of
its surface; and, thirdly, upon its aspect:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The best soil, whether for a house, village,
orchard, or town, is a greenish yellow, fragrant-scented, tart-tasting
loam: such a soil will ensure abundance of gold and silver unto the
third generation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8596src" href="#xd21e8596"
name="xd21e8596src">53</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The best site, whether for a house, village,
orchard, or town, is level.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8606src" href=
"#xd21e8606" name="xd21e8606src">54</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The best aspect (of the surface) is that of land
which is low upon the north side and high upon the south side: such a
site will bring absolute peacefulness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8612src" href="#xd21e8612" name="xd21e8612src">55</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When you have found a site complying with more or less
favourable conditions, in accordance with the code, you must next clear
the ground of forest or undergrowth, lay down four sticks to form a
rectangle in the centre thereof, and call upon the name of the lords of
that spot (<i>i.e.</i> the presiding local deities or spirits). Now dig
up the soil (enclosed by the four sticks), and taking a clod in your
hand, call upon the lords of that spot as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ho, children of M&#277;ntri<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8638src" href="#xd21e8638" name="xd21e8638src">56</a>
Guru,</p>
<p class="line">Who dwell in the Four Corners of the World,</p>
<p class="line">I crave this plot as a boon.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">(Here mention the purpose to which you wish to put
it.)</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;If it is good, show me a good omen,</p>
<p class="line">If it is bad, show me a bad omen.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8658src" href="#xd21e8658" name=
"xd21e8658src">57</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Wrap the clod up in white cloth, and after
fumigating it with incense, place it at night beneath your pillow, and
when you retire to rest repeat the last two lines of the above charm as
before and go to sleep. If your dream is good proceed with, if bad
desist from, your operations. Supposing your dream to be
&ldquo;good,&rdquo; you must (approximately) clear the site of the main
building and peg out the four corners with dead sticks; then take a
dead branch and heap it up lightly with earth (in the centre of the
site?); set fire to it, and when the whole heap has been reduced to
ashes, sweep it all up together and cover it over while you repeat the
charm (which differs but little from that given above). Next morning
uncover it early in the morning and God will show you the good and the
bad. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The site being finally selected, you must proceed to
choose a day for erecting the central house-post, by consulting first
the schedule of lucky and unlucky months, and next the schedule of
lucky and unlucky days of the week.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8670src"
href="#xd21e8670" name="xd21e8670src">58</a></p>
<p class="par">[The best time of day for the operation to take place is
said to be always seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Hence there seems
to be no need to consult a schedule to discover it, though some
magicians may do so.]</p>
<p class="par">The propitious moment having been at last ascertained,
the erection of the centre-post will be proceeded with. First, the hole
for its reception must be dug (the operation being accompanied by the
recital of a charm) and the post erected, the greatest precautions
being taken to prevent the shadow of any of the workers from falling
either upon the post itself or upon the hole dug to receive it,
sickness and trouble being otherwise sure to follow.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8684src" href="#xd21e8684" name="xd21e8684src">59</a></p>
<p class="par">[The account in the Appendix, of which the above is a
<i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i>, omits to describe the sacrifice which has
to be made before the erection of the centre-post, which has therefore
been drawn from the instructions of other magicians.]</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When the hole has been dug and before the
centre-post is actually erected, some sort of sacrifice or offering has
to be made. First you take a little brazilwood (<i lang="ms">kayu
s&#277;pang</i>), a little ebony-wood (<i lang="ms">kayu arang</i>), a
little assaf&oelig;tida (<i lang="ms">inggu</i>), and a little
scrap-iron (<i lang="ms">tahi b&#277;si</i>), and deposit them in the
hole which you have dug. Then take a fowl,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8709src" href="#xd21e8709" name="xd21e8709src">60</a> a goat, or
a buffalo [according to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>the ascertained or reputed
malignity of the locally presiding earth-demon (<i lang=
"ms">puaka</i>)], and cut its throat according to Muhammadan custom,
spilling its blood into the hole. Then cut off its head and feet, and
deposit them within the hole to serve as a foundation for the
centre-post to rest upon (<i lang="ms">buat lapik tiang
s&rsquo;ri</i>). Put a ring on your little finger out of compliment to
the earth-spirit (<i lang="ms">akan m&#277;mbujok j&#277;mbalang
itu</i>), repeat the charm<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8724src" href=
"#xd21e8724" name="xd21e8724src">61</a> and erect the
post.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8732src" href="#xd21e8732"
name="xd21e8732src">62</a></p>
<p class="par">Another form of the above ceremony was described to me
by a magician as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Deposit in the hole a little scrap-iron and
tin-ore, a candle nut (<i lang="ms">buah k&rsquo;ras</i> or <i lang=
"ms">buah gorek</i>), a broken hatchet head (<i lang="ms">b&rsquo;liong
patah</i>), and a cent (in copper). Wait till everybody else has
returned home, and, standing close to the hole, pick up three clods
(<i lang="ms">k&#277;pal</i>) of earth, hold them (<i lang=
"ms">g&#277;nggam</i>) over the incense, turn
&lsquo;right-about-face&rsquo; and repeat the charm.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8770src" href="#xd21e8770" name="xd21e8770src">63</a> Then
take the three clods home (without once turning round to look behind
you till you reach home), place them under your sleeping pillow and
wait till nightfall, when you may have either a good or a bad dream. If
the first night&rsquo;s dream be bad, throw away one of the clods and
dream again. If the second night&rsquo;s dream be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>bad,
repeat the process, and whenever you get a good dream deposit the clod
or clods under the butt-end of the centre-post to serve as a
foundation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A magician gave me this specimen of a charm used at this
ceremony (of erecting the centre-post):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ho, Raja Guru, Maharaja Guru,</p>

<p class="line">Division was made by Adam.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Another rule of importance in house-building is
that which regulates the length of the threshold, as to which the
instructions are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Measure off (on a piece of string) the stretch
(fathom) of the arms of her who is to be mistress of the proposed
house. Fold this string in three and cut off one third. Take the
remainder, fold it in eight and cut off seven-eighths. Take the
remaining eighth, see how many times it is contained in the length of
the threshold, and check off the number (of these measurements) against
the &ldquo;category&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">bilangan</i>) of the
&ldquo;eight beasts&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8812src" href=
"#xd21e8812" name="xd21e8812src">64</a> (<i lang="ms">b&#277;natang
yang d&rsquo;lapan</i>). This category runs as follows:&mdash;(1) The
dragon (<i lang="ms">naga</i>); (2) the dairy-cow (<i lang=
"ms">sapi</i>); (3) the lion (<i lang="ms">singa</i>); (4) the dog
(<i lang="ms">anjing</i>); (5) the draught-cow (<i lang=
"ms">l&#277;mbu</i>); (6) the ass (<i lang="ms">kaldei</i>); (7) the
elephant (<i lang="ms">gajah</i>), and (8) the crow (<i lang=
"ms">gagak</i>), all of which have certain ominous significations.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>If the last measurement coincides with one of
the unlucky beasts in the category, such as the crow (which signifies
the death of the master of the house), the threshold is cut shorter to
make it fit in with one that is more auspicious.&rdquo;<a class=

<p class="par first">In close connection with the ceremonies for the
selection of individual house sites are the forms by which the princes
of Malay tradition selected sites for the towns which they founded. The
following extract will perhaps convey some idea of their
character:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One day Raja Marong Maha Podisat went into his
outer audience hall, where all his ministers, warriors, and officers
were in attendance, and commanded the four <i lang="ms">Mantris</i> to
equip an expedition with all the necessary officers and armed men, and
with horses and elephants, arms and accoutrements. The four <i lang=
"ms">Mantris</i> did as they were ordered, and when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>all
was ready they informed the Raja. The latter waited for a lucky day and
an auspicious moment, and then desired his second son to set out. The
Prince took leave after saluting his father and mother, and all the
ministers, officers, and warriors who followed him performed obeisance
before the Raja. They then set out in search of a place of settlement,
directing their course between south and east, intending to select a
place with good soil, and there to build a town with fort, moat,
palace, and <i lang="ms">balei</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9025src"
href="#xd21e9025" name="xd21e9025src">67</a> They amused themselves in
every forest, wood, and thicket through which they passed, crossing
numbers of hills and mountains, and stopping here and there to hunt
wild beasts, or to fish if they happened to fall in with a pool or
lake.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;After they had pursued their quest for some time
they came to the tributary of a large river which flowed down to the
sea. Farther on they came to a large sheet of water, in the midst of
which were four islands. The Prince was much pleased with the
appearance of the islands, and straightway took a silver arrow and
fitted it to his bow named <i lang="ms">Indra Sakti</i>, and said:
&lsquo;O arrow of the bow <i lang="ms">Indra Sakti</i>, fall thou on
good soil in this group of islands; wherever thou mayest chance to
fall, there will I make a palace in which to live.&rsquo; He then drew
his bow and discharged the arrow, which flew upwards with the rapidity
of lightning, and with a humming sound like that made by a beetle as it
flies round a flower, and went out of sight. Presently it came in sight
again, and fell upon one of the islands, which on that account was
called <i lang="ms">Pulau Indra Sakti</i>. On that spot was erected a
town with fort, palace, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span><i lang="ms">balei</i>, and all
the people who were living scattered about in the vicinity were
collected together and set to work on the various
buildings.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9043src" href="#xd21e9043"
name="xd21e9043src">68</a></p>
<p class="par">Even in the making of roads through the forest it would
appear that sacrificial ceremonies are not invariably neglected. On one
occasion I came upon a party of Malays in the Labu jungle who were
engaged in making a bridle-track for the Selangor Government. A small
bamboo censer, on which incense had been burning, had been erected in
the middle of the trace; and I was informed that the necessary rites
(for exorcising the demons from the trace) had just been successfully
concluded.</p>

<p class="par first">All wild animals, more especially the larger and

(occasionally) superhuman powers.</p>
<p class="par">In the pages which now follow I shall deal with the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Of the Elephant we read:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The superstitious dread entertained by Malays for
the larger animals is the result of ideas regarding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>them
which have been inherited from the primitive tribes of Eastern Asia.
Muhammadanism has not been able to stamp out the deep-rooted feelings
which prompted the savage to invest the wild beasts which he dreaded
with the character of malignant deities. The tiger, elephant, and
rhinoceros<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9077src" href="#xd21e9077" name=
"xd21e9077src">69</a> were not mere brutes to be attacked and
destroyed. The immense advantages which their strength and bulk gave
them over the feebly-armed savage of the most primitive tribes
naturally suggested the possession of supernatural powers; and
propitiation, not force, was the system by which it was hoped to repel
them. The Malay addresses the tiger as <i lang="ms">Datoh</i>
(grandfather), and believes that many tigers are inhabited by human
souls. Though he reduces the elephant to subjection, and uses him as a
beast of burden, it is universally believed that the observance of
particular ceremonies, and the repetition of prescribed formulas, are
necessary before wild elephants can be entrapped and tamed. Some of
these spells and charms (<i lang="ms">mantra</i>) are supposed to have
extraordinary potency, and I have in my possession a curious collection
of them, regarding which, it was told me seriously by a Malay, that in
consequence of their being read aloud in his house three times all the
hens stopped laying! The spells in this collection are nearly all in
the Siamese language, and there is reason to believe that the modern
Malays owe most of their ideas on the subject of taming and driving
elephants to the Siamese. Those, however, who had no idea of making use
of the elephant, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151"
name="pb151">151</a>]</span>who feared him as an enemy, were doubtless
the first to devise the idea of influencing him by invocations. This
idea is inherited, both by Malays and Siamese, from common
ancestry.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9101src" href="#xd21e9101"
name="xd21e9101src">70</a></p>
<p class="par">To the above evidence (which was collected by Sir W. E.
Maxwell no doubt mainly in Perak) I would add that at Labu, in
Selangor, I heard on more than one occasion a story in which the
elephant-folk were described as possessing, on the borders of Siam, a
city of their own, where they live in houses like human beings, and
wear their natural human shape. This story, which was first told me by
Ungku Said K&#277;chil of J&#277;l&#277;bu, was taken down by me at the
time, and ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A Malay named Laboh went out one day to his
rice-field and found that elephants had been destroying his rice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He therefore planted caltrops of a cubit and a
half in length in the tracks of the offenders. That night an elephant
was wounded in the foot by one of the caltrops, and went off bellowing
with pain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Day broke and Laboh set off on the track of the
wounded elephant, but lost his way, and after three days and nights
journeying, found himself on the borders of a new and strange country.
Presently he encountered an old man, to whom he remarked &lsquo;Hullo,
grandfather, your country is extraordinarily quiet!&rsquo; The old man
replied, &lsquo;Yes, for all noise is forbidden, because the
king&rsquo;s daughter is ill.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is the matter with
her?&rsquo; asked Si Laboh. The old man replied that she had trodden
upon a caltrop. Si Laboh then asked, &lsquo;May I see if I can do
anything to help her?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The old man then went and reported the matter to
the king, who ordered Si Laboh to be brought into his presence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;[Now the country which Si Laboh had reached was a
fine open country on the borders of Siam. It is called &lsquo;Pak
H&#277;nang,&rsquo; and its only inhabitants are the elephant-people
who live there in human guise. And whoever trespasses over the
boundaries of that country turns into an elephant.]</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then Si Laboh saw that the king&rsquo;s daughter,
whose name was Princess Rimbut, was suffering from one of the caltrops
which he himself had planted. He therefore extracted it from her foot,
so that she recovered, and the king, in order to reward Si Laboh, gave
him the Princess in marriage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now when they had been married a long time, and
had got two children, Si Laboh endeavoured to persuade his wife to
accompany him on a visit to his own country. To this the Princess
replied &lsquo;Yes; but if I go you must promise never to add to the
dish any young tree-shoots at meal-time.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9126src" href="#xd21e9126" name="xd21e9126src">71</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On this they started, and at the end of the first
day&rsquo;s journey they halted and sat down to eat. But Si Laboh had
forgotten the injunctions of his wife, and put young tree-shoots into
the dish with his rice. Then his wife protested and said, &lsquo;Did I
not tell you not to put young tree-shoots into your food?&rsquo; But Si
Laboh was obstinate, and merely replied, &lsquo;What do I care?&rsquo;
so that his wife was turned back into an elephant and ran off into the
jungle. Then Si Laboh wept and followed her, but she refused to return
as she had now become an elephant. Yet he followed her for a whole day,
but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>she would not return to him, and he then
returned homewards with his children.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is all that is known about the origin of
elephants who are human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A Malay charm which was given me (at Labu) to serve as a
protection against elephants (<i lang="ms">p&#277;ndinding gajah</i>)

</div>
<p class="par first">Ghost elephants (<i lang="ms">gajah kramat</i>)
are not uncommon. They are popularly believed to be harmless, but
invulnerable, and are generally supposed to exhibit some outward and
visible sign of their sanctity, such as a stunted tusk or a shrunken
foot. They are the tutelary genii of certain localities, and when they
are killed the good fortune of the neighbourhood is supposed to depart
too. Certain it is, that when one of these ghost elephants was shot at
Klang a year or two ago, it did not succumb until some fifty or sixty
rifle-bullets had been poured into it, and its death was followed by a
fall in the local value of coffee and coffee land, from which the
district took long to recover.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9151src"
href="#xd21e9151" name="xd21e9151src">72</a></p>
<p class="par">A ghost elephant is very often thought to be the
guardian spirit of some particular shrine&mdash;an idea that is common
throughout the Peninsula.</p>
<p class="par">Other general ideas about the elephant are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Elephants are said to be very frightened if they
see a tree stump that has been felled at a great height <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>from
the ground, as some trees which have high spreading buttresses are cut,
because they think that giants must have felled it, and as
ordinary-sized men are more than a match for them they are in great
dread of being caught by creatures many times more powerful than their
masters. Some of the larger insects of the grasshopper kind are
supposed to be objects of terror to elephants, while the particularly
harmless little pangolin (<i lang="la">Manis pentadactyla</i>) is
thought to be able to kill one of these huge beasts by biting its foot.
The pangolin, by the bye, is quite toothless. Another method in which
the pangolin attacks and kills elephants is by coiling itself tightly
around the end of the elephant&rsquo;s trunk, and so suffocating it.
This idea is also believed in by the Singhalese, according to Mr. W. T.
Hornaday&rsquo;s <i>Two Years in the Jungle</i>.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9168src" href="#xd21e9168" name=
"xd21e9168src">73</a></p>
<p class="par">The foregoing passage refers to Perak, but similar ideas
are common in Selangor, and they occur no doubt, with local variations,
in every one of the Malay States. Selangor Malays tell of the scaring
of elephants by the process of drawing the slender stem of the bamboo
down to the ground and cutting off the top of it, when it springs back
to its place.</p>
<p class="par">The story of the &ldquo;pangolin&rdquo; is also told in
Selangor with additional details. Thus it is said that the
&ldquo;Jawi-jawi&rdquo; tree (a kind of banyan) is always avoided by
elephants because it was once licked by the armadillo. The latter,
after licking it, went his way, and &ldquo;the elephant coming up was
greatly taken aback by the offensive odour, and swore that he would
never go near the tree again. He kept his oath, and his example has
been followed by his descendants, so that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>to this day the
&lsquo;Jawi-jawi&rsquo; is the one tree in the forest which the
elephant is afraid to approach.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">The following directions for hunting the elephant were
given me by L&#277;bai Jamal, a famous elephant hunter of Lingging,
near the Sungei Ujong border:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When you first meet with the spoor of elephant or
rhinoceros, observe whether the foot-hole contains any dead wood,
(then) take the twig of dead wood, together with a ball of earth as big
as a maize-cob taken from the same foot-hole (if there is only one of
you, one ball will do, if there are three of you, three balls will be
wanted, if seven, seven balls, but not more). Then roll up your ball of
earth and the twig together in a tree-leaf, breathe upon it, and recite
the charm (for blinding the elephant&rsquo;s eyes), the purport of
which is that if the quarry sees, its eyesight shall be destroyed, and
if it looks, its eyesight shall be dimmed, by the help of God, the
prophet, and the medicine-man, who taught the charm.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now slip your ball of earth into your waistband
just over the navel, and destroy the scent of your body and your gun.
To do this, take a bunch of certain leaves<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9191src" href="#xd21e9191" name="xd21e9191src">75</a> (<i lang=
"ms">daun sa-ch&#277;rek</i>), together with stem-leaves of the
betel-vine (<i lang="ms">k&#277;rapak sirih</i>), leaves of the wild
camphor (<i lang="ms">chapa</i>), and leaves of the club-gourd
(<i lang="ms">labu ayer puteh</i>), break their midribs with your left
hand, shut your eyes, and say &lsquo;As these tree leaves smell, so may
my body (and gun) be scented.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When the animal is dead, beat it with an end of
black cloth, repeating the charm for driving away the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=

from the carcase, which charm runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">The perquisites of the Pawang (magician) are to be
&ldquo;a little black cloth and a little white cloth,&rdquo; and the
only special taboo mentioned by L&#277;bai Jamal was &ldquo;on no
account to let the naked skin rub against the skin of the slain
animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Before leaving the subject of elephants, I may add that
Raja Ja&#703;far (of Beranang in Selangor) told me that L&#277;bai
Jamal, when charged by an elephant or rhinoceros, would draw upon the
ground with his finger a line which the infuriated animal was never
able to cross. This line, he said, was called the Baris Laksamana, or
the &ldquo;Admiral&rsquo;s Line,&rdquo; and the knowledge of how to
draw it was naturally looked upon as a great acquisition. <span class=

<div class="div4 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main"><i>The Tiger</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;The Tiger is sometimes believed to be a man
or demon in the form of a wild beast, and to the numerous aboriginal
superstitions which attach to this dreaded animal Muhammadanism has
added the notion which connects the Tiger with the Khalif Ali. One of
Ali&rsquo;s titles throughout the Moslem world is &lsquo;the Victorious
Lion of the Lord,&rsquo; and in Asiatic countries, where the lion is
unknown, the <i>tiger</i> generally takes the place of the &lsquo;king
of beasts.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9292src" href=
"#xd21e9292" name="xd21e9292src">78</a></p>
<p class="par">But the anthropomorphic ideas of the Malays about the
Tiger go yet farther than this. Far away in the jungle (as I have
several times been told in Selangor) the tiger-folk (no less than the
elephants) have a town of their own, where they live in houses, and act
in every respect like human beings. In the town referred to their
house-posts are made of the heart of the Tree-nettle (<i lang=
"ms">t&rsquo;ras j&#277;latang</i>), and their roofs thatched with
human hair&mdash;one informant added that men&rsquo;s bones were their
only rafters, and men&rsquo;s skins their house walls&mdash;and there
they live quietly enough until one of their periodical attacks of
fierceness (<i lang="ms">m&#277;ngganas</i>) comes on and causes them
to break bounds and range the forest for their chosen prey.</p>
<p class="par">There are several of these tiger-villages or
&ldquo;enclosures&rdquo; in the Peninsula, the chief of them being
Gunong Ledang (the Mount Ophir of Malacca), just as Pasummah is the
chief of such localities in Sumatra.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9310src" href="#xd21e9310" name="xd21e9310src">79</a> So too,
from Perak, Sir W. E. Maxwell writes in 1881:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A mischievous tiger is said sometimes to have
broken loose from its pen or fold (<i lang="ms">p&#277;chah
kandang</i>). This is in allusion to an extraordinary belief that, in
parts of the Peninsula, there are regular enclosures where tigers
possessed by human souls live in association. During the day they roam
where they please, but return to the <i lang="ms">kandang</i> at
night.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9325src" href="#xd21e9325"
name="xd21e9325src">80</a></p>
<p class="par">Various fables ascribe to the tiger a human origin. One
of these, taken down by me word for word from a Selangor Malay, is
intended to account for the tiger&rsquo;s stripes. The gist of it ran
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An old man picked up a boy in the jungle with a
white skin, green eyes, and very long nails. Taking the boy home his
rescuer named him Muhammad Yatim (<i>i.e.</i> &lsquo;Muhammad the
fatherless&rsquo;), and when he grew up sent him to school, where he
behaved with great cruelty to his schoolfellows, and was therefore
soundly beaten by his master (&rsquo;Toh Saih Panjang Janggut,
<i>i.e.</i> &rsquo;Toh Saih Long-beard), who used a stick made of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>kind of wood called <i lang=
"ms">los</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e9391src" href="#xd21e9391"
name="xd21e9391src">81</a> to effect the chastisement. At the first cut
the boy leapt as far as the doorway; at the second he leapt to the
ground, at the third he bounded into the grass, at the fourth he
uttered a growl, and at the fifth his tail fell down behind him and he
went upon all fours, whereat his master (improvising a name to curse
him by), exclaimed, &lsquo;This is of a truth God&rsquo;s tiger!
(<i lang="ms">Harimau Allah</i>). Go you,&rsquo; he added, addressing
the tiger, &lsquo;to the place where you will catch your prey&mdash;the
borderland between the primeval forest and the secondary forest-growth,
and that between the secondary forest-growth and the plain&mdash;catch
there whomsoever you will, but see that you catch only the headless.
Alter no jot of what I say, or you shall be consumed by the Iron of the
Regalia, and crushed by the sanctity of the thirty divisions of the
Kor&#257;n.&rsquo;&rdquo; Hence the tiger is to this day compelled to
&ldquo;ask for&rdquo; his prey, and uses divination (<i lang=
"ms">b&#277;rt&#277;nung</i>), as all men know, for the purpose of
discovering whether his petition has yet been granted.</p>
<p class="par">Hence, too, he carries on his hide to this very day the
mark of the stripes with which he was beaten at school.</p>
<p class="par">The method of divination said to be practised by the
tiger is as follows: The tiger lies down and gazes (<i lang=
"ms">b&#277;rt&#277;nung</i>) at leaves which he takes between his
paws, and whenever he sees the outline of a leaf take the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>shape of one of his intended victims, <i>without
the head</i>, he knows it to be the sign that that victim has been
&ldquo;granted&rdquo; to him, in accordance with the very terms of his
master&rsquo;s curse.</p>
<p class="par">I once asked (at Labu) how it was known that the tiger
used divination, and was told this story of a man who had seen
it:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A certain Malay had been working, together with
his newly-married wife, in the rice-fields at Labu, and on his stepping
aside at noon into the cool of the forest, he saw a tiger lying down
among the underwood apparently gazing at something between its paws. By
creeping stealthily nearer he was able at length to discern the object
at which the tiger was gazing, and it proved to be, to his intense
horror, a leaf which presented the lineaments of his wife, lacking only
the head. Hurrying back to the rice-field he at once warned the
neighbours of what he had seen, and implored them to set his wife in
their midst and escort her homeward. To this they consented, but yet,
in spite of every precaution, the tiger broke through the midst of them
and killed the woman before it could be driven off. The bereaved
husband thereupon requested them to leave him alone with the body and
depart, and when they had done so, he took the body in his arms, and so
lay down embracing it, with a dagger in either hand. Before sunset the
tiger returned to its kill, and leapt upon the corpse, whereupon the
husband stabbed it to the heart, so that the points of the daggers met,
and killed it on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The power of becoming a man- or were-tiger (as it has
sometimes been called), is supposed to be confined to one tribe of
Sumatrans, the Korinchi Malays, many of whom are to be met with in the
Malay Native States. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161"
name="pb161">161</a>]</span>This belief is very strongly held, and on
one occasion, when I asked some Malays at Jugra how it could be proved
that the man really became a tiger, they told me the case of a man some
of whose teeth were plated with gold, and who had been accidentally
killed in the tiger stage, when the same gold plating was discovered in
the tiger&rsquo;s mouth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9437src" href=
"#xd21e9437" name="xd21e9437src">82</a></p>
<p class="par">Of the strength of the Malay belief in were-tigers Mr.
Clifford writes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The existence of the Malayan Loup Garou to the
native mind is a fact, and not a mere belief. The Malay <i>knows</i>
that it is true. Evidence, if it be needed, may be had in plenty; the
evidence, too, of sober-minded men, whose words in a Court of Justice
would bring conviction to the mind of the most obstinate jurymen, and
be more than sufficient to hang the most innocent of prisoners. The
Malays know well how Haji &#703;Abdallah, the native of the little
state of Korinchi in Sumatra, was caught naked in a tiger trap, and
thereafter purchased his liberty at the price of the buffaloes he had
slain while he marauded in the likeness of a beast. They know of the
countless Korinchi men who have vomited feathers, after feasting upon
fowls, when for the nonce they had assumed the forms of tigers; and of
those other men of the same race who have left their garments and their
trading packs in thickets whence presently a tiger has emerged. All
these things the Malays know have happened, and are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>happening to-day, in the land in which they
live, and with these plain evidences before their eyes, the empty
assurances of the enlightened European that Were-Tigers do not, and
never did exist, excite derision not unmingled with
contempt.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9455src" href="#xd21e9455"
name="xd21e9455src">83</a></p>
<p class="par">Writing on the same theme, Sir Frank Swettenham
says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Another article of almost universal belief is
that the people of a small State in Sumatra called Korinchi have the
power of assuming at will the form of a tiger, and in that disguise
they wreak vengeance on those they wish to injure. Not every Korinchi
man can do this, but still the gift of this strange power of
metamorphosis is pretty well confined to the people of the small
Sumatran State. At night when respectable members of society should be
in bed, the Korinchi man slips down from his hut, and, assuming the
form of a tiger, goes about &lsquo;seeking whom he may
devour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have heard of four Korinchi men arriving in a
district of Perak, and that night a number of fowls were taken by a
tiger. The strangers left and went farther up country, and shortly
after only three of them returned and stated that a tiger had just been
killed, and they begged the local headman to bury it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On another occasion some Korinchi men appeared
and sought hospitality in a Malay house, and there also the fowls
disappeared in the night, and there were unmistakable traces of the
visit of a tiger, but the next day one of the visitors fell sick, and
shortly after vomited chicken-feathers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is only fair to say that the Korinchi people
strenuously deny the tendencies and the power ascribed to them, but
aver that they properly belong to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>inhabitants of a
district called Chen&acirc;ku in the interior of the Korinchi country.
Even there, however, it is only those who are practised in the <i lang=
"ms">el&#277;mu s&#277;hir</i>, the occult arts, who are thus capable
of transforming themselves into tigers, and the Korinchi people profess
themselves afraid to enter the Chen&acirc;ku district.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9476src" href="#xd21e9476" name=
"xd21e9476src">84</a></p>
<p class="par">There are many stories about ghost tigers (<i lang=
"ms">rimau kramat</i>), which are generally supposed to have one foot a
little smaller than the others (<i lang="ms">kaki tengkis</i>). During
my stay in the Langat district I was shown on more than one occasion
the spoor of a ghost tiger. This happened once near Sepang village, on
a wet and clayey bridle-track, where the unnatural smallness of one of
the feet was very conspicuous. Such tigers are considered invulnerable,
but harmless to man, and are looked upon generally as the guardian
spirits of some sacred spot. One of these sacred spots was the shrine
(<i lang="ms">kramat</i>) of &rsquo;Toh Kamarong, about two miles north
of Sepang village. This shrine, it was alleged, was guarded by a white
ghost elephant and ghost tiger, who ranged the country round but never
harmed anybody. One day, however, a Chinaman from the neighbouring
pepper plantations offered at this shrine a piece of <i>pork</i>,
which, however acceptable it might have been to a Chinese saint, so
incensed the orthodox guardians of this Muhammadan shrine that one of
them (the ghost tiger) fell upon the Chinaman and slew him before he
could return to his house.</p>
<p class="par">By far the most celebrated of these ghost tigers,
however, were the guardians of the shrine at the foot of Jugra Hill,
which were formerly the pets of the Princess of Malacca (Tuan
P&#365;tri Gunong Ledang). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=
"#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>Local report says that this
princess left her country when it was taken by the Portuguese, and
established herself on Jugra Hill, a solitary hill on the southern
portion of the Selangor coast, which is marked on old charts as the
&ldquo;False Parcelar&rdquo; hill.</p>
<p class="par">The legend which connects the name of this princess with
Jugra Hill was thus told<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9501src" href=
"#xd21e9501" name="xd21e9501src">85</a> by Mr. G. C. Bellamy (formerly
of the Selangor Civil Service).</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bukit Jugra (Jugra Hill) in its isolated
position, and conspicuous as it is from the sea, could scarcely escape
being an object of veneration to the uneducated Malay mind. The jungle
which clothes its summit and sides is supposed to be full of <i lang=
"ms">hantus</i> (demons or ghosts), and often when talking to Malays in
my bungalow in the evening have our discussions been interrupted by the
cries of the <i lang="ms">langswayer</i> (a female birth-demon) in the
neighbouring jungle, or the mutterings of the <i lang="ms">bajang</i>
(a familiar spirit) as he sat on the roof-tree. But the
&lsquo;Putri&rsquo; (Princess) of Gunong Ledang holds the premier
position amongst the fabulous denizens of the jungle on the hill, and
it is strange that places so far apart as Mount Ophir and Bukit Jugra
should be associated with one another in traditionary lore. The story

"xd21e9524src" href="#xd21e9524" name="xd21e9524src">87</a> of fabulous
dimensions as her sole attendant. This cat appears to have been a most
amiable and accommodating creature, for on arriving at Jugra he carried
the Princess on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165"
name="pb165">165</a>]</span>his back to the top of the hill. Here the
lady remained for some time, and during her stay constructed a
bathing-place for herself. Even to this day she pays periodical visits
to Jugra Hill, and although she herself is invisible to mortal eye, her
faithful attendant, in the shape of a handsome tiger, is often to be
met with as he prowls about the place at night. He has never been known
to injure any one, and is reverently spoken of as a <i lang="ms">rimau
kramat</i> (ghost tiger).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">To the above story Mr. C. H. A. Turney (then Senior
District Officer and stationed at Jugra) added the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Princess and the stories about her and the
tiger are well known, and the latter are related from mother to
daughter in Langat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are, however, they say, one or two
omissions; instead of one tiger there were two, the real <i lang=
"ms">harimau kramat</i> and an ambitious young tiger who would also
follow the Princess in her round of visits. This brute came to an
untimely and ignominious end (as he deserved to) at the hands of one
Innes, who was disturbed whilst reading a newspaper, and this can be
verified by Captain Syers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The other tiger jogged along gaily with his
phantom mistress, and made night hideous with his howlings and
prowlings all about the Jugra Hill. He was really <i lang=
"ms">kramat</i>, and was said to have been shot at by several Malays,
and the present Sergeant-Major Allie, now stationed at Kuala Lumpur,
can vouch for this.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9553src" href=

"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">I myself collected at the time the following extra
details:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The local version of the legend about the
<i lang="ms">kramat</i> at the foot of Jugra Hill runs somewhat as
follows:&mdash;Once upon a time one Nakhoda Ragam was travelling with
his wife (who is apparently to be identified with the Princess of
Malacca, Tuan P&#365;tri Gunong Ledang) in a boat (<i lang=
"ms">sampan</i>), when the latter pricked him to death with a needle
(<i lang="ms">mati di-chuchok jarum</i>). His blood flooded the boat
(<i lang="ms">darah-nya hanyut dalam sampan</i>), and presently the
woman in the boat was hailed by a vessel sailing past her. &lsquo;What
have you got in that boat?&rsquo; said the master of the vessel, and
the Princess replied: &lsquo;It is only spinach-juice&rsquo; (<i lang=
"ms">kuah bayam</i>). She was therefore allowed to proceed, and landed
at the foot of Jugra Hill, where she buried all that yet remained of
her husband, which consisted of only one thigh (<i lang=
"ms">paha</i>).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9608src" href="#xd21e9608"
name="xd21e9608src">89</a> She also took ashore her two cats, which
were in the boat with her, and which, turning into ghost tigers, became
the guardians of this now famous shrine.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9611src" href="#xd21e9611" name="xd21e9611src">90</a></p>
<p class="par">Tigers are naturally too fierce to be tracked by the
Malays, and are usually caught in specially constructed traps (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;njara rimau</i>), or killed by a self-acting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>gun
or spear-trap (<i lang="ms">b&rsquo;lantek s&rsquo;napang</i>, <i lang=
"ms">b&rsquo;lantek t&#277;rbang</i>, <i lang="ms">b&rsquo;lantek
parap</i>, etc.); but even in this case the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>
explains to the tiger that it was not he but Muhammad who set the trap.
There are, however, as might be expected, a great number of charms
intended to protect the devotee in various ways from the tiger&rsquo;s
claws and teeth. Of these I will give one or two typical specimens.</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes a charm is used to keep the tiger at a
distance (<i lang="ms">p&#277;njauh rimau</i>):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ho, B&#277;rs&#277;nu! Ho, B&#277;rkaih!</p>

<p class="line">If you do not go wide,</p>
<p class="line">You shall be a rebel unto God,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Sometimes the desired effect is expected to be
obtained by a charm for locking the tiger&rsquo;s jaws:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ho, Sir Cruncher! Ho, Sir Muncher!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=

<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line">By the virtue of &lsquo;There is no god but

<p class="par first">To which may be added&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">By the virtue of &lsquo;There is no god but

</div>
<p class="par first">When tigers were wounded, it was said (in
Selangor) that they would doctor themselves with <i lang="ms">ubat
tasak</i>, which is the name generally given to a sort of poultice used
by those who have just undergone circumcision. And when a tiger was
killed a sort of public reception was formerly always accorded to him
on his return to the village.</p>
<p class="par">Though I have not seen the actual reception (generally
miscalled a &ldquo;wake&rdquo;), I once saw near Kajang in Selangor a
tiger which had been prepared for the ceremony. The animal was propped
up on all fours as if alive, and his mouth kept open by propping
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>the roof with a stick. It was unfortunately
impossible for me to wait for the ceremony, but from a description
which I received afterwards, it was evidently regarded as a sort of
&ldquo;reception&rdquo; given by the people of the village to a live
and powerful war-chief or champion (<i lang="ms">hulubalang</i>) who
had come to pay them a visit, the dancing and fencing which takes place
on such occasions being intended for his entertainment.</p>
<p class="par">One of these ceremonies, which took place in Jugra in
Selangor, was thus described:&mdash;</p>

<h5 class="main"><i>A Tiger&rsquo;s Wake</i></h5>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;At 10 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> a great
noise of rejoicing, with drums and gongs, approaching Jugra by the
river, was heard, and on my questioning the people, I was told Raja
Yakob had managed to shoot a tiger with a spring gun behind Jugra Hill,
and was bringing it in state to the Sultan. I went over to the
Sultan&rsquo;s at Raja Yakob&rsquo;s request to see the attendants on
the slaughter of a tiger. The animal was supported by posts and
fastened in an attitude as nearly as possible approaching the living.
Its mouth was forced open, its tongue allowed to drop on one side, and
a small rattan attached to its upper jaw was passed over a pole held by
a man behind. This finished, two swords were produced and placed
crosswise, and a couple of Panglimas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9800src" href="#xd21e9800" name="xd21e9800src">93</a> selected
for the dance; the gongs and drums were beaten at a quick time, the man
holding the rattan attached to the tiger&rsquo;s head pulled it, moving
the head up and down, and the two Panglimas, after making their
obeisance to the Sultan, rushed at their swords, and holding them in
their hands commenced a most wild and exciting dance. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>They
spun around on one leg, waving their swords, then bounded forward and
made a thrust at the tiger, moving back quickly with the point of the
weapon facing the animal; they crawled along the ground and sprung over
it uttering defiant yells, they cut and parried at supposed attacks,
finally throwing down their weapons and taunting the dead beast by
dancing before it unarmed. This done, Inas told me the carcase was at
my disposal.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The death of the tiger now establishes the fact
of the existence of tigers here, for asserting which I have been pretty
frequently laughed at. However this is not the Jugra pest, a brute
whose death would be matter for general rejoicing, the one now
destroyed being a tigress 8 feet long and 2 feet 8 inches
high.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9807src" href="#xd21e9807"
name="xd21e9807src">94</a></p>
<p class="par">I may add that both the claws and whiskers of tigers are
greatly sought after as charms, and are almost invariably stolen from a
tiger when one is killed by a European. I have also seen at Klang a
charm written on tiger&rsquo;s skin.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Anthropomorphic ideas are held by the Malays
almost as strongly in the case of the Deer as of any other animal.</p>
<p class="par">The Deer is, by all Malays, believed to have sprung from
a man who suffered from a severe ulcer or abscess (<i lang=
"ms">chabuk</i>) on the leg, (which is supposed to have left its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>trace on the deer&rsquo;s legs to this day). Of
the Perak form of this legend Sir William Maxwell writes as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The deer (<i lang="ms">rusa</i>) is sometimes
believed to be the metamorphosed body of a man who has died of an
abscess in the leg (<i lang="ms">chabuk</i>), because it has marks on
the legs which are supposed to resemble those caused by the disease
mentioned. Of course there are not wanting men ready to declare that
the body of a man who has died of <i lang="ms">chabuk</i> has been seen
to rise from the grave and to go away into the forest in the shape of a
deer.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9871src" href="#xd21e9871"
name="xd21e9871src">96</a></p>
<p class="par">The Selangor legend is practically identical with that
current in Perak.</p>
<p class="par">The deer are frequently addressed, in the charms used by
the hunters, exactly as if they were human beings,
<i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;If you wish to wear bracelets and rings</p>
<p class="line">Stretch out your two fore-feet.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">These rings and bracelets are of course the nooses
which depend from the toils.</p>
<p class="par">In a charm of similar import we find:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ho, Crown Prince (Raja Muda) with your Speckled
Princess (P&#365;tri Dandi),</p>
<p class="line">Rouse you quickly (from your slumbers)</p>
<p class="line">And clasp (round your neck) King Solomon&rsquo;s
necklace.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">I may add that in some places the <i lang=
"ms">Pawang</i> (magician) will himself first enter the toils, probably
with the object of deceiving the stag as to their nature and
purpose.</p>
<p class="par">The ceremonies for hunting deer are somewhat
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>intricate, and it will perhaps be best to
commence by giving a general description of deer-catching as practised
by the Malays.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This pastime&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9914src" href="#xd21e9914" name="xd21e9914src">97</a>
(deer-catching) &ldquo;is one the Malay delights in. After a rainy
night, deer may be easily traced to their lair by their footprints, and
as they remain stationary by day the hunters have ample time to arrange
their apparatus. When the hiding-place is discovered all the young men
of the <i lang="ms">kampong</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e9924src"
href="#xd21e9924" name="xd21e9924src">98</a> assemble, and the
following ceremony is performed before they sally out on the
expedition: Six or eight coils of rattan rope, about an inch in
diameter, are placed on a triangle formed with three rice-pounders, and
the oldest of the company, usually an experienced sportsman, places a
cocoa-nut shell filled with burning incense in the centre, and taking
sprigs of three bushes, viz. the <i lang="ms">jellatang</i>, <i lang=
"ms">sapunie</i>, and <i lang="ms">sambon</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9936src" href="#xd21e9936" name="xd21e9936src">99</a> plants
(these, it is supposed, possess extraordinary virtues), he walks
mysteriously round the coils, beating them with the sprigs, and
erewhile muttering some gibberish, which, if possessing any meaning,
the sage keeps wisely to himself. During the ceremony the youths of the
village look on with becoming gravity and admiration. It is believed
that the absence of this ceremony would render the expedition
unsuccessful, the deer would prove too strong for the ropes, and the
wood demons frustrate their sport by placing insurmountable obstacles
in their way. Much faith appears to be placed in the ceremony. Each
coil referred to above is sixty to seventy fathoms long, and to the
rope running nooses, made also of rattan rope, are attached about three
feet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>apart from each other. On reaching the thicket
wherein the deer are concealed, stakes are driven into the ground a few
feet apart in a straight line, the coils are then opened out, and the
rope attached to the stakes, two or three feet above the ground, with
the nooses hanging down, and two of the party conceal themselves near
the stakes armed with knives for the purpose of despatching the deer
when entangled in the nooses. The remainder of the hunters arrange
themselves on the opposite side of the thicket and advance towards it,
shouting and yelling at the top of their voices. The deer, startled
from their rest, spring to their feet and naturally flee from the noise
towards the nooses, and in a short time are entangled in them. As they
struggle to escape, the concealed hunters rush out and despatch them.
Occasionally the flight is prolonged till the major party arrives, and
then the noble creatures soon fall beneath the spears and knives of
their assailants. The animal is divided between the
sportsmen.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9949src" href="#xd21e9949"
name="xd21e9949src">100</a></p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;gibberish&rdquo; employed by the deer
<i lang="ms">Pawangs</i> when the latter enter the jungle is intended
to induce the wood demons and earth demons to recede, or at least to
dissuade them from active interference with the proceedings. Charms are
also employed by the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, as he proceeds, from time
to time, to &ldquo;ask for&rdquo; a tree (to which the toils may be
fastened); to &ldquo;ask for&rdquo; a deer; to unroll and suspend the
toils; to call upon the spirits (who are the herdsmen of the deer) to
drive the latter down to meet the dogs; to turn back the deer when they
have got away; to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"
name="pb174">174</a>]</span>&ldquo;prick&rdquo; or urge on the dogs, or
make them bark; to stop wild dogs from barking in the jungle, or those
of the pack from barking at the wrong moment; to deceive the deer as to
the reality of the toils used by the hunters; to deceive the spirits as
to the identity of the hunting-party; and, finally, to drive out the
&ldquo;mischief&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">badi</i>) from the carcase of the
slain animal; examples of all of which will be found in the course of
the next few pages.</p>

<p class="par">The Mouse-deer or chevrotin is the &ldquo;Brer

attention of the doe is attracted. Whatever the reason may be, there is

&ldquo;This is his (King Solomon&rsquo;s) gong.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The stick which is used may be of any kind of wood
except a creeper, and the best place for the operation is where the
ground sounds hollow when tapped. Either three, five, or seven leaves
must, however, be laid on the spot before the tapping is commenced.</p>
<p class="par">The directions for setting the snare (<i lang=

down by me as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">First look for a tree whose sap is viscid, and chop at
it thrice (with a cutlass). If the splinters fall, one the right and
the other the wrong way up (lit. one prone and the other supine), it is
a bad sign (though it is a good sign when one is setting a trap); for
in the case of a snare they must fall the wrong way up (supine).</p>
<p class="par">When this is done, commence to set the snare near the
foot of a tree, at about a fathom&rsquo;s distance, and say:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<h5 class="main"><i>Hunting-Dogs</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Hunting-dogs are spoken to continually as if they
were human beings. Several examples of this occur in the deer
charms.</p>
<p class="par">Thus we find the following passage addressed to the
dogs:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Let not go the scent,</p>
<p class="line">Formidable were you from the first;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="line">Hot-foot, hot-foot, do you pursue,</p>
<p class="line">If you do not pursue hot-foot,</p>
<p class="line">I will minimise my benediction (lit. my &lsquo;Peace be
with you&rsquo;).</p>
<p class="line">If it (the deer) be a buck, you shall have him for a
brother;</p>
<p class="line">If it be a doe, you shall have her for a
wife.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">So too, again, after calling several dogs by name,
the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> gets together the accessories (leaves of
the <i lang="ms">tukas</i> and <i lang="ms">l&#277;njuang</i>, a brush
of leaves (<i lang="ms">sa-ch&#277;rek</i>) and a black cloth), and
exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Bark, Sir Slender-foot; bark, Sir
Brush-tail.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> generally tries to
deceive the deer as to his ownership of the hunting-dogs. Thus he will
say:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;It is not I whose dogs these are,</p>
<p class="line">It is the magical deer <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> whose
dogs these are.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">So, too, they are called by certain specific names
(according to their breed and colour), which are in several cases
identical with the names of the dogs with which the wild Spectre
Huntsman (the most terrible of all personified diseases in the Malay
category) hunts down his prey.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10646src"
href="#xd21e10646" name="xd21e10646src">111</a></p>
<p class="par">Ugliness is by no means looked upon as a disadvantage,
but rather the opposite. An ugly dog is apparently formidable. Thus we
find a dog addressed as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Let not go the scent (of the quarry)</p>
<p class="line">As you were formidable (lit. ugly)<a class="noteref"

the first.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Again, the description of the &ldquo;good
points&rdquo; of some of these dogs which is given in the Appendix
would, if ugliness and formidability are convertible terms, satisfy the
most exacting whipper-in, the so-called good points being for the most
part a mere list of deformities. These points, however, are merely the
external sign of the Luck to which dogs, as well as human beings, are
believed to be born. In a fine passage we are told:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;From the seven Hills and the seven Valleys</p>
<p class="line">Comes the intense barking of my Dogs.</p>
<p class="line">My Dogs are Dogs of Luck,</p>

<p class="line">But Luck incarnate with their bodies.</p>
<p class="line">Go tread upon the heaped and rotting leaves,</p>
<p class="line">And never desert the scent.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Speaking of dog-lore generally, it may be remarked
that though dogs are very frequently kept by the <span class=

&ldquo;The dog ... is unlucky. He longs for the death of his master, an

the house was in disorder, as if some struggle had taken place, and the
bear was covered with blood. Hastily drawing the conclusion that the
bear had killed and devoured the child, the enraged father slew the
animal with his spear, but almost immediately afterwards he found the
carcase of a tiger, which the faithful bear had defeated and killed,
and the child emerged unharmed from the jungle, where she had taken
refuge. It is unnecessary to point out the similarity of this story to
the legend of Beth-Gelert. It is evidently a local version of the story

<p class="par">Monkeys and men have always been associated in native
tradition, and Malay folklore is no exception to the rule. Thus we get
the tradition of the great man-like ape, the Mawas (a reminiscence of
the orang-outang or mias of Borneo), which is said to make shelters for
itself in the forks of trees, and to be born with the blade of a
cutlass (woodknife) in place of the bone of the forearm, so that it is
able to cut down the undergrowth as it walks through the jungle. It

end.</p>
<p class="par">Then Si Malim Panjang, elder brother of Si Malim Bongsu,
decided to take the place of his younger brother, and be married to the
Princess Telan. The latter, however, repelled his advances, and he
therefore attacked her savagely; but she <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

an ape (<i lang="ms">siamang</i>) and escaped to the jungle, so that Si

<i lang="ms">pagar-anak</i> tree which grew on the sea-shore, and
leaned over the sea, and there she chanted these words:&mdash;</p>

on recognising the voice of the Princess Telan he took a blow-gun and
shot her so that she fell into the sea. Then he took rose-water and
sprinkled it over her, so that she resumed her natural shape, and they
started to go home together. Still, however, Si Malim Bongsu would not
wed her, but promised that he would do so when he came back from his
next voyage, whereupon the Princess chanted these words:&mdash;</p>

Malay proverbial expression which means, &ldquo;&lsquo;To make the
monkey judge,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;to go to the monkey for justice.&rsquo;
A fable is told by the Malays of two men, one of whom planted bananas
on the land of the other. When the fruit was ripe each claimed it, but
not being able to come to any settlement they referred the matter to
the arbitration of a monkey (of the large kind called <i lang=
"ms">brok</i>). The judge decided that the fruit must be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>divided; but no sooner was this done than one of
the suitors complained that the other&rsquo;s share was too large. To
satisfy him the monkey reduced the share of the other by the requisite
amount, which he ate himself. Then the second suitor cried out that the
share of the first was now too large. It had to be reduced to satisfy
him, the subtracted portion going to the monkey as before. Thus they
went on wrangling until the whole of the fruit was gone, and there was
nothing left to wrangle about. Malay judges, if they are not
calumniated, have been known to protract proceedings until both sides
have exhausted their means in bribes. In such cases the unfortunate
suitors are said to <i lang="ms">berhakim kapada

<h5 class="main"><i>The Wild Pig and Other Animals</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There are several superstitions about the Wild
Boar which prove that it was not always regarded as an unclean
animal.</p>
<p class="par">Of these the following recipe, which was given me by a
Jugra (Selangor) Malay, for turning brass into gold is the most
remarkable:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Kill a wild pig and rip open its paunch. Sew up
in this a quantity of old &lsquo;scrap&rsquo; brass, pile timber over
it, burn it, and then leave it alone until the grass has grown right
over it. Then dig up the gold.&rdquo; Again, certain wild boars are
believed to carry on their tushes a talisman of extraordinary power,
which is called <i lang="ms">rantei babi</i>, or &ldquo;Wild
Boar&rsquo;s Chain.&rdquo; This chain consists, it is asserted, of
three links of various metals (gold, silver, and amalgam), and is hung
up on a shrub by the wild boar when he is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>enjoying his wallow,
so that it is occasionally stolen by Malays who know his habits. I may
add that, according to a Malay at Langat, the &ldquo;were-tiger&rdquo;
(<i lang="ms">rimau jadi-jadian</i>) occasionally appears in the shape
of a wild boar escaping from a grave, in the centre of which may be
afterwards seen the hole by which the animal has escaped.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Among the modern Malays avoidance of the flesh of
swine and of contact with anything connected with the unclean animal
is, of course, universal. No tenet of El-Islam is more rigidly enforced
than this. It is singular to notice, among a people governed by the
ordinances of the Prophet, traces of the observance of another form of
abstinence enjoined by a different religion. The universal preference
of the flesh of the Buffalo to that of the Ox in Malay countries is
evidently a prejudice bequeathed to modern times by a period when
cow-beef was as much an abomination to Malays as it is to the Hindus of
India at the present day. This is not admitted or suspected by ordinary
Malays, who would probably have some reason, based on the relative
wholesomeness of buffalo and cow-beef, to allege in defence of their
preference of the latter to the former.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10976src" href="#xd21e10976" name="xd21e10976src">124</a></p>
<p class="par">To the above I may add that it is invariably the flesh
of the Buffalo, and not that of the Ox, which is eaten sacrificially on
the occasion of festivities.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10986src" href=
"#xd21e10986" name="xd21e10986src">125</a> But the flesh of the
so-called White (albino) Buffalo (<i lang="ms">k&#277;rbau balar</i>)
is generally avoided as food, though I have known it to be prescribed
medicinally (as in the case of Raja Kahar, a son of H.H. the Sultan of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=

will be detailed elsewhere).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11000src" href=
"#xd21e11000" name="xd21e11000src">126</a> As might be expected, a
story is told by the Malays to account for this distinction. The
general outline of the tale is to the effect that a Malay boy (a mere
child) fell into the big rice-bin (<i lang="ms">k&#277;pok</i>) in his
parents&rsquo; absence and was suffocated by the rice. After some days
the body began to decompose, and the ooze emanating from the rice-bin
was licked up by a buffalo belonging to the boy&rsquo;s parents. The
attention of these latter being thus attracted to the rice-bin, they
found therein the remains of their child, and thereupon cursed the
buffalo, which (we are led to infer) became &ldquo;white,&rdquo; and
has remained so ever since. According to one version, a ground-dove
(<i lang="ms">t&#277;kukur</i>) was implicated both in the offence and
the punishment which followed it. Wherefore to this day no man eats of
the flesh of either of the offenders.</p>
<p class="par">Perhaps the most extraordinary transformation in which
the Malays implicitly believe is that of the Squirrel, which is
supposed to be developed from a large caterpillar called <i lang=
"ms">ulat s&#277;ntadu</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11017src" href=
"#xd21e11017" name="xd21e11017src">127</a></p>
<p class="par">About the Cat there are many superstitions which show
that it is believed to possess supernatural powers. Thus it is supposed
to be lucky to keep cats because they long for a soft cushion to lie
upon, and so (indirectly) wish for the prosperity of their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=

href="#xd21e11044" name="xd21e11044src">128</a> On the other hand, cats
must be very carefully prevented from rubbing up against a corpse, for
it is said that on one occasion when this was neglected, the <i lang=
"ms">badi</i> or Evil Principle which resides in the cat&rsquo;s body
entered into the corpse, which thus became endowed with unnatural life
and stood up upon its feet. So too the soaking of the cat in a pan of
water until it is half-drowned is believed to produce an abundance of
rain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11060src" href="#xd21e11060" name=
"xd21e11060src">129</a> It is, besides, believed to be extremely
unlucky to kill cats. Of this superstition Mr. Clifford
says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is a common belief among Malays that if a cat
is killed he who takes its life will in the next world be called upon
to carry and pile logs of wood, as big as cocoa-nut trees, to the
number of the hairs on the beast&rsquo;s body. Therefore cats are not
<i>killed</i>; but if they become too daring in their raids on the
hen-coop or the food rack, they are tied to a raft and sent floating
down stream, to perish miserably of hunger. The people of the villages
by which they pass make haste to push the raft out again into
mid-stream, should it in its passage adhere to bank or bathing-hut, and
on no account is the animal suffered to land. To any one who thinks
about it, this long and lingering death is infinitely more cruel than
one caused by a blow from an axe; but the Malays do not trouble to
consider such a detail, and would care little if they
did.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11073src" href="#xd21e11073"
name="xd21e11073src">130</a></p>
<p class="par">Before leaving the subject of cats, I must mention the
belief that the &ldquo;fresh-water fish called <i lang="ms">ikan
belidah</i>&rdquo; was &ldquo;originally a cat.&rdquo; Sir W. E.
Maxwell says that many Malays refuse to eat it for this reason, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>adds, &ldquo;They declare that it squalls like a
cat when harpooned, and that its bones are very white and fine like a
cat&rsquo;s hairs.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11085src" href=
"#xd21e11085" name="xd21e11085src">131</a> A story is also sometimes
told to account both for the general similarity of habits of the cat
and the tiger and for the fact that the latter, unlike most of the
<i lang="la">Felid&aelig;</i>, is not a tree-climber. It is to the
effect that the cat agreed to teach the tiger its tricks, which it did,
with the exception of the art of climbing trees. The tiger, thinking it
had learnt all the cat&rsquo;s tricks, proceeded to attack its teacher,
when the cat escaped by climbing up a tree; so the tiger never learnt
how to climb and cannot climb trees to this day.</p>
<p class="par">Even the smallest and commonest of mammals, such as Rats
and Mice, are the objects of many strange beliefs. Thus &ldquo;clothes
which have been nibbled by rats or mice must not be worn again. They
are sure to bring misfortune, and are generally given away in
charity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11098src" href="#xd21e11098"
name="xd21e11098src">132</a></p>
<p class="par">So too on the Selangor coast a mollusc called <i lang=
"ms">siput tantarang</i> or <i lang="ms">m&#277;ntarang</i> is believed
to have sprung from a mouse; and many kinds of charms, generally
addressed to the &ldquo;Prophet Joseph&rdquo; (Nabi Yusuf), are
resorted to in order to drive away rats and mice from the
rice-fields.</p>
<p class="par">The following passage describes the general ideas about
animal superstitions which prevail on the east coast of the
Peninsula:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The beliefs and superstitions of the Fisher Folk
would fill many volumes. They believe in all manner of devils and local
sprites. They fear greatly the demons that preside over animals, and
will not willingly mention the names of birds or beasts while
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>at sea. Instead, they call them all <i lang=
"ms">ch&ecirc;weh</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e11119src" href=
"#xd21e11119" name="xd21e11119src">133</a>&mdash;which, to them,
signifies an animal, though to others it is meaningless, and is
supposed not to be understanded of the beasts. To this word they tack
on the sound which each beast makes in order to indicate what animal is
referred to; thus the pig is the grunting <i lang=
"ms">ch&ecirc;weh</i>, the buffalo the <i lang="ms">ch&ecirc;weh</i>
that says &lsquo;<i lang="ms">uak</i>,&rsquo; and the snipe the
<i lang="ms">ch&ecirc;weh</i> that cries &lsquo;<i lang=
"ms">kek-kek</i>.&rsquo; Each boat that puts to sea has been medicined
with care, many incantations and other magic observances having been
had recourse to, in obedience to the rules which the superstitious
people have followed for ages. After each take the boat is
&lsquo;swept&rsquo; by the medicine man with a tuft of leaves prepared
with mystic ceremonies, which is carried at the bow for the purpose.
The omens are watched with exact care, and if they be adverse no
fishing-boat puts to sea that day. Every act in their lives is
regulated by some regard for the demons of the sea and air, and yet
these folk are nominally Muhammadans, and, according to that faith,
magic and sorcery, incantations to the spirits, and prayers to demons,
are all unclean things forbidden to the people. But the Fisher Folk,
like other inhabitants of the Peninsula, are Malays first and
Muhammadans afterwards. Their religious creed goes no more than skin
deep, and affects but little the manner of their daily
life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11144src" href="#xd21e11144"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Vegetation Spirit of the Malays &ldquo;follows
in some vague and partial way,&rdquo; to use Professor Tylor&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>words, from the analogy of the Animal Spirit. It
is difficult to say, without a more searching inquiry than I have yet
had the opportunity of making, whether Malay magicians would maintain
that <i>all</i> trees had souls (<i lang="ms">s&#277;mangat</i>) or
not. All that we can be certain of at present is that a good many trees
are certainly supposed by them to have souls, such, for instance, as
the Durian, the Cocoa-nut palm, and the trees which produce Eagle-wood
(<i lang="ms">gharu</i>), Gutta Percha, Camphor, and a good many
others.</p>
<p class="par">What can be more significant than the words and actions
of the men who in former days would try and frighten the Durian groves
into bearing; or of the toddy-collector who addresses the soul of the
Cocoa-nut palm in such words as, &ldquo;Thus I bend your neck, and roll
up your hair; and here is my ivory toddy-knife to help the washing of
your face&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11169src" href=
"#xd21e11169" name="xd21e11169src">135</a> or of the collectors of
jungle produce who traffic in Eagle-wood, Camphor, and Gutta (the
spirits of the first two of which trees are considered extremely
powerful and dangerous) or, above all, of the reapers who carry the
&ldquo;Rice-soul&rdquo; home at harvest time?</p>
<p class="par">A special point in connection with the Malay conception
of the vegetation soul perhaps requires particular attention, viz. the
fact that apparently dead and even seasoned timber may yet retain the
soul which animated it during its lifetime. Thus, the instructions for
the performance of the rites to be used at the launching of a boat
(which will be found below under the heading &ldquo;The Sea, Rivers,
and Streams&rdquo;)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11179src" href=
"#xd21e11179" name="xd21e11179src">136</a> involve an invocation to the
timbers of the boat, which would therefore seem to be conceived as
capable, to some extent, of receiving impressions and communications
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>made in accordance with the appropriate forms
and ceremonies.</p>
<p class="par">So, too, a boat with a large knot in the centre of the
bottom is considered good for catching fish, and in strict conformity
with this idea is the belief that the natural excrescences (or knobs)
and deformities of trees are mere external evidences of an indwelling
spirit. So, too, the fruit of the cocoa-nut palm, when the shell lacks
the three &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; to which we are accustomed, is believed to
serve in warfare as a most valuable protection (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;lias</i>) against the bullets of the enemy, and the same
may be said in a minor degree of the joints of &ldquo;solid&rdquo;
bamboo (<i lang="ms">buluh tumpat</i>) which are occasionally found,
whilst to a slightly different category belong the comparatively
numerous examples of &ldquo;Tabasheer&rdquo; (mineral concretions in
the wood of certain trees), which are so highly valued by the Malays
for talismanic purposes. Such trees as the <i lang="ms">Mali mali</i>,
<i lang="ms">Rotan j&#277;r&rsquo;nang</i> (Dragon&rsquo;s-blood
rattan), <i lang="ms">Buluh kasap</i> (rough bamboo), etc., are all
said to supply instances of the concretions referred to, but the most
famous of them all is without doubt the so-called &ldquo;cocoa-nut
pearl,&rdquo; of which I quote the following account from Dr.
Denys&rsquo;s <i>Descriptive Dictionary of British Malaya</i>.</p>
<div class="div4 section">

<p class="par first">The following remarks concerning these peculiar
accretions are extracted from <i>Nature</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;During my recent travels,&rdquo; Dr. Sidney
Hickson writes to a scientific contemporary, &ldquo;I was frequently
asked by the Dutch planters and others if I had ever seen &lsquo;a
cocoa-nut stone.&rsquo; These stones are said to be rarely found (1 in
2000 or more) in the perisperm <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196"
href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>of the cocoa-nut, and when
found are kept by the natives as a charm against disease and evil
spirits. This story of the cocoa-nut stone was so constantly told me,
and in every case without any variation in its details, that I made
every effort before leaving to obtain some specimens, and eventually
succeeded in obtaining two.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One of these is nearly a perfect sphere, 14 mm.
in diameter, and the other, rather smaller in size, is irregularly
pear-shaped. In both specimens the surface is worn nearly smooth by
friction. The spherical one I have had cut into two halves, but I can
find no concentric or other markings on the polished cut surfaces.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dr. Kimmins has kindly submitted one-half to a
careful chemical analysis, and finds that it consists of pure carbonate
of lime without any trace of other salts or vegetable tissue.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should be very glad if any of your readers
could inform me if there are any of these stones in any of the museums,
or if there is any evidence beyond mere hearsay of their existence in
the perisperm of the cocoa-nut.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">On this letter Mr. Thiselton Dyer makes the following
remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;Dr. Hickson&rsquo;s account of the calcareous
concretions occasionally found in the central hollow (filled with
fluid&mdash;the so-called &lsquo;milk&rsquo;) of the endosperm of the
seed of the cocoa-nut is extremely interesting. It appears to me a
phenomenon of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197"
name="pb197">197</a>]</span>same order as tabasheer, to which I
recently drew attention in <i>Nature</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The circumstances of the occurrence of these
stones or &lsquo;pearls&rsquo; are in many respects parallel to those
which attend the formation of tabasheer. In both cases mineral matter
in palpable masses is withdrawn from solution in considerable volumes
of fluid contained in tolerably large cavities in living plants; and in
both instances they are <i lang="la">monocotyledons</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the case of the cocoa-nut pearls the material
is calcium carbonate, and this is well known to concrete in a peculiar
manner from solutions in which organic matter is also present.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In my note on tabasheer I referred to the
reported occurrence of mineral concretions in the wood of various
tropical <i lang="la">dicotyledonous</i> trees. Tabasheer is too well
known to be pooh-poohed; but some of my scientific friends express a
polite incredulity as to the other cases. I learn, however, from Prof.
Judd, F.R.S., that he has obtained a specimen of apatite found in
cutting up a mass of teak-wood. The occurrence of this mineral under
these circumstances has long been recorded; but I have never had the
good fortune to see a specimen.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par first">The Durian tree (for an account of whose famous
fruit the classical description in Wallace&rsquo;s <i>Malay
Archipelago</i> may be referred to) is a semi-wild fruit-tree, whose
stem frequently rises to the height of some eighty or ninety feet
before the branches are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href=

in groves, which are often to be found in the jungle when all other
traces of former human habitation have completely disappeared, though
even then its fruit, if tradition says true, is as keenly fought over
by the denizens of the forest (monkeys, bears, and tigers) as ever it
was by their temporary dispossessors. Interspersed among the Durian
trees will be found numerous varieties of orchard trees of a less
imperial height, amongst which may be named the Rambutan,<a class=

grew within about a mile of my bungalow at Jugra, and I was informed
that in years gone by a curious ceremony (called <i lang=

more productive. On a specially selected day, it was said, the village
would assemble at this grove, and (no doubt with the usual
accompaniment of the burning of incense and scattering of rice) the
most barren of the Durian trees would be singled out from the rest. One
of the local <i lang="ms">Pawangs</i> would then take a hatchet
(<i lang="ms">b&#277;liong</i>) and deliver several shrewd blows upon
the trunk of the tree, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">&ldquo;One of the largest and stateliest of the forest

great irritation when it comes in contact with the skin. Two Chinamen
who had felled one of these trees in ignorance, had their faces so
swelled and inflamed that they could not see out of their eyes, and had
to be led about for some days before they recovered from the effects of
the poison. Their arms, breasts, and faces were affected, and they
presented the appearance of having a very bad attack of erysipelas.
These trees are supposed to be the abiding-places of <i lang=
"ms">hantu</i>, or spirits, when they have large hollow projections
from the trunk, called <i lang="ms">rumah hantu</i>, or spirit houses.
These projections are formed when a branch gets broken off near the
trunk, and are quite characteristic of the tree. There are sometimes
three or four of them on a large tree, and the Malays have a great
objection to cutting down any that are so disfigured, the belief being
that if a man fells one he will die within the year. As a rule these
trees are left standing when clearings are made, and they are a source
of trouble and expense to planters and others, who object to their
being left uncut.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The following series of events actually
happened:&mdash;A Malay named Panda Tambong undertook, against the
advice of his friends, to fell one of the Toh Allong trees, and he
almost immediately afterwards was taken ill with fever, and died in a
few weeks&rsquo; time. Shortly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203"

the shade of another of these ill-omened trees, when, without any
warning, a large branch fell down, breaking the arm of one man, and
more or less injuring two others. There was not a breath of wind at the
time, or anything else likely to determine the fall of the branch.
After this it was decided to have the tree felled, as there were coolie
houses nearly under it. There was great difficulty in getting any one
to fell it. Eventually a Penang Malay undertook the job, but stipulated
that a <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, or sorcerer, should be employed to
drive away the demons first. The Pawang hung pieces of white and red
cloth on sticks round the tree, burnt incense in the little
contrivances made of the split leaf-stalks of the <i lang=
"ms">b&#277;rtam</i> palm, used by the Malays for that purpose, cut off
the heads of two white fowls, sprinkled the blood over the trunk, and
in the midst of many incantations the tree was felled without any
mishap; but, strange to say, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, who was a
<i lang="ms">haji</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e11480src" href=

speak as well as birds and animals, and several of the trees now to be
seen in the forest are really metamorphosed human beings. Such are the
&lsquo;J&#277;lotong&rsquo; and the &lsquo;B&#277;rombong,&rsquo; which
in the days of King Solomon were bosom friends, until there broke out
between them an unfortunate quarrel, which terminated in &lsquo;Si
J&#277;lotong&rsquo;s&rsquo; lacing the skin of &lsquo;Si
B&#277;rombong&rsquo; all over with stabs from his dagger, the effect
of which stabs remains visible to this day. Si B&#277;rombong, on the
other hand, cursed Si J&#277;lotong with his dying breath, praying that
he might be turned into a tree without any buttresses to support his
trunk, a prayer which was, of course, duly fulfilled. Thus originated
the lack of buttresses at the base of the former tree, and the laced
and slashed bark of the latter.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p class="par first">The result of this invocation is, or should be,
that the <i lang="ms">gharu</i>-spirit appears to the wizard
(generally, no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>doubt, in a dream), and informs him what kind of
sacrifice he requires on this particular occasion. Whatever kind of
sacrifice is asked for, must of course be given, <i>with the exception
of a human sacrifice which, as it is expressly stated, may be
compounded by the sacrifice of a fowl</i>.</p>
<p class="par">When the tree has been felled you must be exceedingly
careful to see that nobody passes between the end of the fallen trunk
and the stump; whoever does so will surely be killed by the
&ldquo;eagle-wood spirit,&rdquo; who is supposed to be extremely
powerful and dangerous. I myself received a warning to this effect from
some Labu Malays when I saw one of these trees felled. Malays maintain
that men are frequently killed by this spirit (<i lang="ms">mati
d&#277;&rsquo; Hantu Gharu</i>), but that they may be recalled to life
if the following recipe is acted upon:&mdash;&ldquo;Take two
&lsquo;cubits&rsquo; (?) of &lsquo;Panchong leaves&rsquo; (<i lang=
"ms">daun panchong dua heta</i>), flowers of the <i lang="ms">sunting
mambang</i>, and &lsquo;bullock&rsquo;s eye&rsquo; limes (<i lang=
"ms">limau mata k&#277;rbau</i>), squeeze [the limes(?)] and rub them
over the corpse, saying, &lsquo;Sir Allah! Sir Mangga Tangan!
God&rsquo;s Essence is in your heart (lit. liver). God&rsquo;s
attributes are in your eyes. Go and entertain the male Borer-Bee that
is in your heart and liver.&rsquo; <i>The dead man will then revive and
stand upon his feet.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The most important point about eagle-wood, however, from
the animistic point of view, is the <i lang="ms">Pawang&rsquo;s</i> use
of the <i lang="ms">gharu m&#277;rupa</i>, a strangely shaped piece of
eagle-wood which possesses a natural resemblance to some animal or
bird. It is believed to contain the soul of the tree, and therefore is
always, when possible, carried by the collectors of eagle-wood in the
belief that it will aid them in their search. I myself once owned one
of these <i lang="ms">gharu m&#277;rupa</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>which possessed a remarkable resemblance to a
bird. This appears to me very fairly sufficient evidence to prove that
the tree-soul is not supposed by the Malays necessarily to resemble a
tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12188src" href="#xd21e12188" name=

<p class="par">&ldquo;Amongst these superstitions the most important is
the use of a special language, the subject of the present paper, which
has been the means of preserving some remnants of the aboriginal
dialects of this part of the Malay Peninsula. This language is called
by the <i lang="ms">Orang Hulu</i> &ldquo;Pantang Kapur&rdquo;;
<i lang="ms">pantang</i> means forbidden or tabooed, and in this case
refers to the fact that in searching for the camphor the use of the
ordinary Malay language is <i lang="ms">pantang</i>, or forbidden. In

thirty-three of which are Malay or derived from Malay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Jakuns believe that there is a
&ldquo;<i lang="ms">bisan</i>,&rdquo; or spirit, which presides over
the camphor-trees, and without propitiating this spirit it is
impossible to obtain the camphor. This <i lang="ms">bisan</i> makes at
night a shrill noise, and when this sound is heard it is a sure sign
that there are camphor-trees near at hand. (This <i lang="ms">bisan</i>
is really one of the Cicadas which are so numerous in the Malayan
jungles.)</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When hunting for camphor the natives always throw
a portion of their food out into the jungle before eating, as an
offering to the <i lang="ms">bisan</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No prayers are offered up, but all food must be

stewed fish, or vegetables. Salt must not be pounded fine; if it is
eaten fine, the camphor when found will be in fine grains; but if eaten
coarse the grains of camphor will be large. In rainy weather the cry of
the <i>bisan</i> is not heard. At certain seasons regular parties of
Jakuns, and sometimes Malays, go into the jungle to search for camphor,
and they remain there as long as three or four months at a time. Not
only must the men who go into the jungle to search for the camphor
speak the &lsquo;Pantang Kapur,&rsquo; but also the men and women left
at home in the Kampongs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The camphor occurs in the form of small grains
deposited in the cracks in the interior of the trunk <span class=

the tree. Camphor is only found in the older trees, and not in all of
these, and to obtain it the tree must be cut down and split up. There
are certain signs which indicate when a tree contains camphor, one of
which is the smell emitted from the wood when chipped. A man who is
skilled in detecting the presence of camphor is called Penghulu
Kapur.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12329src" href="#xd21e12329" name=

<p class="par first">The following rules have an evident bearing upon
the subject of vegetable animism. They were collected at Langat, in
Selangor:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">The time to plant Sugar-cane is at noon: this will make
it sweeter, by drying up the juice and leaving the saccharine matter.
If you plant it in the early morning its joints will be too long, if in
the middle of the day they will be short.</p>
<p class="par">Plant Maize with a full stomach, and let your dibble be
thick, as this will swell the maize ear.</p>
<p class="par">For Plantains (or Bananas) you must dig a big hole, and
the evening is the time to plant them. The evening is the quicker, and
if planted after the evening meal they fill out better.</p>
<p class="par">Plant Sweet Potatoes on a starry night to ensure their
filling out properly (by getting plenty of eyes?)</p>
<p class="par">Plant Cucumbers and Gourds on a dark moonless
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>night, to prevent them from being seen and
devoured by fire-flies (<i lang="ms">api-api</i>).</p>
<p class="par">Plant Cocoa-nuts when the stomach is overburdened with
food (<i lang="ms">kalau kita &rsquo;nak sangat berak</i>); run quickly
and throw the cocoa-nut into the hole prepared for it without
straightening the arm; if you straighten it the fruit-stalk will break.
Plant them in the evening, so that they may bear fruit while they are
still near the ground. When you pick seed cocoa-nuts off the tree
somebody should stand at the bottom of the tree and watch whether the
&ldquo;monkey-face&rdquo; of each seed cocoa-nut, as it is thrown down,
turns either towards himself or the base of the tree, or whether it
looks away from both. In the former case the seed will be good, in the
latter it is not worth planting.</p>
<p class="par">Plant Rice in the early morning, about five, because
that is the hour at which infants (the Rice Soul being considered as an
infant) get up.</p>

<h5 class="main"><i>The Cultivation of Rice</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The most important contribution of the Malays to
the animistic theory of vegetation is perhaps to be found in the many
strange ceremonies with which they surround the culture of Rice. In
order to properly understand the significance of these ceremonies,
however, a proper understanding of the Malay system of rice-planting is
essential, and I therefore quote <i lang="la">in extenso</i> a
description of rice-culture, which possesses the additional interest of
being translated from the composition of a Malay:<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">&ldquo;It is the established custom in Malacca territory
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=

doing so generally falls about the month of Zilka&#703;idah or
Zilhijah.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12552src" href="#xd21e12552" name=
"xd21e12552src">187</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In starting planting operations, however, the
object is, if possible, to coincide with the season when the West wind
blows, because at that time there are frequent rains, and accordingly
the earth of the rice-field becomes soft and easy to plough. Moreover,
in planting rice it is an invariable rule that there must be water in
the field, in order that the rice may sprout properly; though, on the
other hand, if there is too great a depth of water the rice is sure to
die. It has also been observed that as a rule the season of the West
wind coincides with the fourth month<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12557src" href="#xd21e12557" name="xd21e12557src">188</a> of the

<p class="par">&ldquo;2. In olden time the order of planting operations
was as follows:&mdash;First, the elders had to hold a consultation with

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;(1) A strong buffalo (to pull the plough).</li>
<li>(2) A plough with its appurtenances (to turn over the earth and the
short weeds).</li>
<li>(3) A harrow with its appurtenances (to level and break up small
the clods of earth left by the plough).</li>
<li>(4) A roller with its appurtenances (to knock down the long weeds,
such as sedges, in fields that have lain fallow for a long while).</li>
<li>(5) A wood-cutter&rsquo;s knife, to mend any of the implements that
may get out of order at the time of ploughing.</li>
<li>(6) A hoe to repair the embankments and level the higher
grounds.</li>
<li>(7) A scythe<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12599src" href=

<li>(8) And a whip to urge the buffalo on if he is lazy.</li>
</ul>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;3. When the proper season has arrived for
beginning the work of planting, and the elders have come to an
agreement with the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, then on some Friday after
the service in the Mosque the P&#277;nghulu addresses all the people
there present, saying that on such a day of the month every one who is
to take part in rice-cultivation must bring to the Mosque half a quart
of grain (for &lsquo;mother-seed&rsquo;) in order that <i lang=
"ms">Maulud</i> prayers may be read over it. (At that time <i lang=

are to read those prayers.)</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When the <i lang="ms">Maulud</i> prayers are
over, every man goes down to the rice-field, if possible on the same
day or the next one, in order to begin ploughing the nursery plot, that
is, the plot which is near his house or in which he has been in the
habit of sowing the seed every year. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But if a man has a great number of plots, he will
begin by ploughing half of them, and then at the end of the month of
Zilhijah he must diligently prepare the nursery plot so as to be ready
in about ten days&rsquo; time.</p>

<p class="par first">&ldquo;4. Before sowing one must first of all lay
out the grain, both the seed-grain and the &lsquo;mother-seed,&rsquo;
each separately, to dry. It must then be soaked in a vessel (a bucket
or pot) for two days and two nights, after which it is taken out,
strained and spread quite evenly on a mat with fresh leaves (areca-nut
fronds are best), and every afternoon one must sprinkle water on it in
order that the germ may quickly break through, which will happen
probably in two days&rsquo; time or thereabouts.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;5. While the seed is soaking, the nursery plot
must be carefully prepared; that is to say, it must be ploughed over
again, harrowed, levelled, ditched, and the soil allowed to settle; the
embankments must be mended, and the surface made smooth. When the germs
have sprouted the seed is taken to the nursery plot. Benzoin supplied
by the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> is burnt, and the plot sprinkled with
<i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12657src" href="#xd21e12657" name="xd21e12657src">194</a> Then a
beginning is made by sowing the &lsquo;chief of the seed,&rsquo;
<i>i.e.</i> &lsquo;mother-seed,&rsquo; in one corner of the nursery
prepared for the purpose, and about two yards square; afterwards the
rest of the seed is sown all over the plot. It is well to sow when the
plot contains plenty of water, so that all the germs of the seed may be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>uppermost, and the roots may not grow long, but
may be pulled up easily. <i>The time for sowing must be during the dark
half of the month, so that the seedlings may be preserved from being
eaten by insects.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e12695src" href=
"#xd21e12695" name="xd21e12695src">195</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Three days after the seed is sown the young
shoots begin to rise like needles, and at that time all the water
should be drawn off the plot; after seven days they are likened to a
sparrow&rsquo;s tail, and about the tenth or fifteenth day they break
out into blades. At that period the water is again let into the plot,
little by little, in order that the stalks of the seedlings may grow
thick.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The seedlings have to remain in the nursery for
at least forty or forty-four days from the time of sowing before they
are sufficiently grown; it is best to let them remain till they are
about seventy days old.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;6. While the seedlings are in the nursery the
other plots are being ploughed, one after another; and this is called
the first ploughing. Then the embankments are mended and re-formed with
earth, so that the water in the field may not escape and leave it dry.
After the embankments have been mended the harrowing begins: a start is
made with the plot that was first ploughed (other than the nursery
plot), for there the earth will have become soft, and the weeds being
rotten after many days of soaking in the water will form a sort of
manure. Each plot is so dealt with in its turn. Then all have to be
ploughed once more (which is called the second ploughing) and harrowed
again; for the first harrowing merely breaks up the clods of earth, and
a second is required to reduce them to a fine state and to kill the
weeds. Most people, having first used an iron harrow, use a wooden one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>for the second harrowing, in order that the
earth may be broken up quite fine. Their rice is sure to thrive better
than that of people who are less careful; for in rice-planting, as the
saying goes, there is &lsquo;the plighted hope of good that is to
come,&rsquo; in the way of bodily sustenance I mean. So day by day the
different plots are treated in the way that has been described in
connection with the nursery plot in paragraph 5 above.</p>

long the ends can be clipped a little, and the roots are then steeped
in manure. This manure is made of buffalo bones burnt with chaff till
they are thoroughly calcined, and then pounded fine, passed through a
sieve and mixed with mud: that is the best kind of manure for
rice-planting, and is known as &lsquo;stock manure.&rsquo; (It can also
be applied by merely scattering it in the fields. In that case, after

ten or fifteen female labourers can be engaged to assist in planting,

a modern method, and is at present mainly practised by the people
living in the neighbourhood of the town of Malacca, in order to get the
work done quickly; but in olden times it was not allowed, and even to
this day the people who live in the inland parts of the territory of
Malacca prefer to clip their rice with a <i lang=

a time [<i>i.e.</i> without threshing it]. (If labourers are employed
to do this their wage is one-tenth of the rice cut.) It takes ever so
many days to get the work done, but the idea is that this method is the
pious one, the &lsquo;Soul of the Rice&rsquo; not being disturbed
thereby. A good part of the people hold this belief, and assert that
since the custom of threshing the rice has been introduced, the crops
have been much less abundant than in years of olden time when it was
the custom to use the <i lang="ms">tuai</i> only.</p>

share of the hire of a buffalo and all other expenses incidental to
rice-planting), or of threefold division (that is, for example, the
owner bears all expenses, in which case the man who does the work can
get a third of the produce; or the latter bears all expenses, in which
case the owner only gets a third of the produce). Or again, the land
can be let; for instance, a field which ordinarily produces a <i lang=

two hundred gallons more or less.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;16. Every cultivator who does not act in
accordance with the ordinance laid down in paragraphs 9 and 10 above,
will be in the same case as if he disregarded all the prohibitions laid
down in connection with planting. If a man does not carry out this
procedure he is sure to fail in the end; his labour will be in vain and
will not fulfil his desires, for the virtue of all these ordinances and
prohibitions lies in the fact that they protect the rice, and drive
away all its enemies, such as grubs, rats, swine, and the

Rice</span></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following account (by Mr. C. O. Blagden) of
the ceremony of planting out the young rice (from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>rice-nursery) appeared in the <i>Journal of the
Straits Asiatic Society</i> in 1896:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In agricultural operations the animistic ideas of
the Malays are clearly apparent: thus, before the rice is cut a sort of
ritual is performed which is known as <i lang="ms">puji padi</i>, and
which is regarded, apparently, as a kind of propitiatory service, a
sort of apology to the <i lang="ms">padi</i> (rice) for reaping it. The
<i lang="ms">padi</i> is usually sprinkled with <i lang=
"ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i> (flour mixed with water) before the reaping
is commenced, and the first lot cut is set apart for a ceremonial
feast.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At planting there are also ceremonies: as a rule
the beginning of the planting season is ushered in by a visit of the
whole body of villagers to the most highly revered <i lang=
"ms">kramat</i> in the neighbourhood, where the usual offerings are
made and prayers are said. Sometimes, however, there is a special
service known as <i lang="ms">b&#259;pua</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13059src" href="#xd21e13059" name="xd21e13059src">206</a>
consisting of a sort of mock combat, in which the evil spirits are
believed to be expelled from the rice-fields by the villagers: this is
not done every year, but once in three or four years.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Another occasional service of a peculiar
character, which is not of very frequent occurrence, is the ceremony
which would perhaps be best described as the propitiation of the
earth-spirit. Some years ago I happened, by chance, to be present at a
function of this kind, and as its details may be of some interest as
illustrating the wide dispersion of certain points of ritual, I will
end these notes by giving a full description of it as noted down at the
time. It was in the month of October, and I happened to be out shooting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>snipe in the <i lang="ms">padi</i>-fields of the
village of S&#277;batu on a Sunday morning, when I was met by the
<i lang="ms">P&#277;nghulu</i>, the headman of the village, who asked
me to leave off shooting for an hour or so. As I was having fair sport,
I naturally wanted to know the reason why, so he explained that the
noise of gunshots would irritate the <i lang="ms">hantu</i>, and render
unavailing the propitiatory service which was then about to begin.
Further inquiry elicited the statement that the <i lang="ms">hantu</i>
in question was the one who presided over rice-lands and agricultural
operations, and as I was told that there would be no objection to my
attending the ceremony, I went there and then to the spot to watch the
proceedings. The place was a square patch of grass-lawn a few yards
wide, which had evidently for years been left untouched by the plough,
though surrounded by many acres of rice-fields. On this patch a small
wooden altar had been built: it consisted simply of a small square
platform of wood or bamboo raised about three or four feet above the
ground, each corner being supported by a small sapling with the leaves
and branches left on it and overshadowing the platform, the sides of
which appeared to face accurately towards the four cardinal points. To
the western side was attached a small bamboo ladder leading from the
ground to the edge of the platform. At the four corners of the patch of
grass were four larger saplings planted in the ground. On the branches
of all these trees were hung a number of <i lang=
"ms">k&#277;tupats</i>, which are small squarish bags plaited of strips
of the leaves of the screw-pine (<i lang="ms">m&#277;ngkuang</i>) or
some similar plant, like the material of which native bags and mats are
made. A larger <i lang="ms">k&#277;tupat</i> hung over the centre of
the altar, and all of them were filled with a preparation of boiled
rice. On the altar were piled up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232"
href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>various cooked foods laid on
plantain leaves, including the flesh of a goat cooked in the ordinary
way, as well as rice and different kinds of condiments and sweetmeats.
The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> was present as well as a number of the
villagers, and soon after my arrival with the <i lang=
"ms">P&#277;nghulu</i> the ceremony began by some of the villagers
producing out of a bag the skin of a black male goat with the head and
horns attached and containing the entrails (the flesh having been
cooked and laid on the altar previously). A large iron nail four or
five inches long, and thick in proportion, was placed vertically in a
hole about two feet deep which had been dug under the altar, and the
remains of the goat were also buried in it, with the head turned
towards the east, the hole being then closed and the turf replaced.
Some of the goat&rsquo;s blood, in two cocoa-nut shells (<i lang=
"ms">t&#277;mpurong</i>), was placed on the ground near the south side
and south-west corner of the altar close to the ladder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>, after assisting at
these preliminaries, then took his stand at the west side of the altar,
looking eastward: he covered his head, but not his face, with his
<i lang="ms">sarong</i> wrapped round it like a shawl, and proceeded to
light a torch, the end of which was tipped with incense (<i lang=
"ms">k&#277;m&#277;nyan</i>). With this he touched the bottom of the
altar platform four times. He then took a cup of <i lang=
"ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i> and dipped in it a small bundle of four
kinds of leaves, with which he then sprinkled the north-west and
south-east corners of the platform. He then coughed three
times&mdash;whether this was part of the ritual, or a purely incidental
occurrence, I am unable to say, as it was not practicable to stop the
ceremony for the purpose of asking questions&mdash;and again applied
the torch under the altar and sprinkled with <i lang="ms">t&#277;pong
tawar</i> all the corners of it, as well as the rungs of the ladder.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At this stage of the proceedings four men
stationed in the rice-field beyond the four corners of the patch of
turf, each threw a <i lang="ms">k&#277;tupat</i> diagonally across to
one another, while the rest of the assembly, headed by the <i lang=
"ms">P&#277;nghulu</i>, chanted the <i lang="ms">kalimah</i>, or
Muhammadan creed, three times.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then a man holding a large bowl started from a
point in the rice-field just outside the north side of the patch of
turf, and went round it (first in a westerly direction). As he walked,
he put handfuls of the rice into his mouth and spat or vomited them
out, with much noise, as if to imitate violent nausea, into the field.
He was followed closely by another who also held a bowl filled with
pieces of raw tapioca root and <i lang="ms">b&#277;ras b&#277;rtih</i>
(rice roasted in a peculiar way),<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13144src"
href="#xd21e13144" name="xd21e13144src">207</a> which he threw about
into the field. Both of them went right round the grass plot. The
<i lang="ms">Pawang</i> then took his cup of <i lang="ms">t&#277;pong
tawar</i> and sprinkled the <i lang="ms">anak padi</i>, that is, the
rice-shoots which were lying in bundles along the south and east sides
of the altar ready for planting. Having sprinkled them he cut off the
ends, as is usually done; and after spitting to the right and to the
left, he proceeded to plant them in the field. A number of others then
followed his lead and planted the rest of the rice-plants, and then a
sweetmeat made of cocoa-nut and sugar was handed round, and Muhammadan
prayers were said by some duly qualified person, an <i lang="ms">orang
&#703;alim</i> or a <i lang="ms">l&#277;bei</i>, and the ceremony was
concluded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was explained to me that the blood and the
food were intended for the <i lang="ms">hantu</i>, and the ladder up to
the altar was for his convenience; in fact the whole affair was a
propitiatory service, and offers curious analogies with the sacrificial
ceremonials of some of the wild <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234"
href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>aboriginal tribes of Central
India who have not been converted to Hinduism or Isl&#257;m. That it
should exist in a Malay community within twenty miles of the town of
Malacca, where Muhammadanism has been established for about
six<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13172src" href="#xd21e13172" name=
"xd21e13172src">208</a> centuries, is certainly strange. Its obvious
inconsistency with his professed religion does not strike the average
Malay peasant at all. It is, however, the fact that these observances
are not regarded with much favour by the more strictly Muhammadan
Malays of the towns, and especially by those that are partially of Arab
descent. These latter have not much influence in country districts, but
privately I have heard some of them express disapproval of such rites
and even of the ceremonies performed at <i>kramats</i>. According to
them, the latter might be consistent with Muhammadan orthodoxy on the
understanding that prayers were addressed solely to the Deity; but the
invocation of spirits or deceased saints and their propitiation by
offerings could not be regarded as otherwise than polytheistic
idolatry. Of course such a delicate distinction&mdash;almost as subtle
as that between <i>dulia</i> and <i>latria</i> in the Christian worship
of saints&mdash;is entirely beyond the average Malay mind; and
everything is sanctioned by immemorial custom, which in an agricultural
population is more deeply-rooted than any book-learning; so these rites
are likely to continue for some time, and will only yield gradually to
the spread of education. Such as they are, they seem to be interesting
relics of an old-world superstition.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have mentioned only a few such points, and only
such as have been brought directly to my knowledge; there are hosts of
other quaint notions, such as the theory <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>of lucky and unlucky
days and hours, on which whole treatises have been written, and which
regulate every movement of those who believe in them; the belief in
amulets and charms for averting all manner of evils, supernatural and
natural; the practice during epidemics of sending out to sea small
elaborately constructed vessels which are supposed to carry off the
malignant spirits responsible for the disease (of which I remember a
case a few years ago in the village of Sempang, where the beneficial
effect was most marked); the widespread belief in the power of <i lang=
"ms">m&#277;nuju</i>, that is, doing injury at a distance by magic, in
which the Malays believe the wild junglemen especially to be adepts;
the belief in the efficacy of forms of words as love-charms and as a
protection against spirits and wild beasts&mdash;in fact, an
innumerable variety of superstitious ideas exist among
Malays.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13192src" href="#xd21e13192"

<li>10. A hen&rsquo;s egg.</li>
<li>11. A stone (a small block of quartz).</li>

<p class="par">Close to the <i lang="ms">dulang</i> stood a cocoa-nut
shell filled with the <i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>, which plays
so prominent a part in Malay magic ceremonies, and a brush made up of
the leaves of seven different plants, bound up as usual with a cord of
<i lang="ms">kulit t&rsquo;rap</i> (the bark of the Wild Breadfruit),
and <i lang="ms">ribu-ribu</i> (a kind of small creeper). The plants
which supplied the leaves of which the brush was composed, were as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">1. <i lang="ms">Sap&#277;noh.</i> 2. <i lang=

<p class="par">But the most interesting object was a small oval-shaped

creeper, and about fourteen inches long, which was standing just in
front of the three rice-baskets and close to the <i lang=
"ms">Pawang</i>, and which, as I afterwards found out, was intended to
serve as the cradle of the Rice-soul (or &ldquo;Rice-baby&rdquo;). I
examined it, however, and found that as yet it only contained the
following objects:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. A strip of white cloth (folded up and lying at the bottom of the
basket).</li>
<li>2. Some parti-coloured thread (<i lang="ms">b&#277;nang

<li>3. A hen&rsquo;s egg.</li>
<li>4. One of the hard jungle-nuts (candle-nuts) already referred
to.</li>
<li>5. A cockle shell (<i lang="ms">k&rsquo;rang</i>).</li>
<li>6. A long iron nail.</li>
<li>7. Five cubits of red cloth by means of which the soul-basket was
to be slung round the neck of its bearer. (The correcter custom would
require an expensive cloth of the kind called <i lang="ms">jong
sarat</i>, or the &ldquo;Loaded Junk,&rdquo; according to my informant
the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Three new Malay skirts or <i>sarongs</i> were added,
(one to each basket), and everything being ready, the various
receptacles described above were entrusted to five female bearers
(<i lang="ms">P&#277;njawat</i>), who descended from the house, with
the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> at their head, and set out for the
rice-field. Before they had gone many yards they were joined by the
owner of the field, who walked in front of them bearing what was called
the <i lang="ms">junjongan padi</i>. This was the stem and leaves of a
dark red kind of sugar-cane, which was used in substitution for the
black or &ldquo;raven&rdquo; variety (<i lang="ms">t&#277;bu gagak</i>)
which, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> explained, would have been used in
preference if it had been obtainable. Meanwhile the procession passed
on, and the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> repeated as we went the following
prayer to the spirits:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238"

<p class="par first">On reaching the rice the procession filed through
a lane already made in the rice, until the &ldquo;mother-sheaf&rdquo;
was reached from which the Rice-soul was to be taken. But immediately
on arriving at the spot, and before depositing the rice-baskets on the
ground, the Pawang repeated these lines:&mdash;</p>

the ends fell upon her shoulders, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> now stood
up facing the sheaf, and waved the ends of this cloth thrice upward to
the right, thrice upward to the left, and finally thrice upward to the
right again. Then for a few moments she stood still, close to the sheaf
with her head bent forward and buried among the ears, after which she
reseated herself and dabbled the <i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>
thrice upon the roots of the sheaf. One of the female bearers now
planted the stem of the sugar-cane upright in the centre of the
sheaf,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13494src" href="#xd21e13494" name=
"xd21e13494src">213</a> whilst the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> sprinkled it

sugar-cane in the centre of the sheaf, and (pressing the sheaf more
tightly round the sugar-cane) drew the waist of the sheaf together and
belted it with some of the outer stems of the sheaf itself; then the
<i lang="ms">Pawang</i> applied the <i lang="ms">t&#277;pong
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=

fumigating it in the usual manner, ran her hands up it. Next she took
in one hand (out of the brass tray) the stone and the egg, cockle-shell
and candle-nut, and with the other planted the big iron nail in the
centre of the sheaf close to the foot of the sugar-cane. Then she took
in her left hand the cord of tree-bark, and after fumigating it,
together with all the vessels of rice and oil, took up some of the rice
and strewed it round about the sheaf, and then tossed the remainder
thrice upwards, some of it falling upon the rest of the company and
myself.</p>
<p class="par">This done, she took the end of the cord in both hands,
and encircling the sheaf with it near the ground, drew it slowly upward
to the waist of the sheaf, and tied it there, after repeating what is

and picking it up, deposited it in the centre of the sheaf.</p>
<p class="par">Next she took the contents of the soul-basket (the egg

with oil and fumigating them, replaced them in the basket; then taking
the <i lang="ms">p&#277;nuwei sulong</i> (&ldquo;Eldest
Rice-cutter&rdquo;), anointed the blade with the oil of frankincense,
and inserting the thumb of the right hand into her mouth, pressed it
for several moments against the roof of her palate. On withdrawing it
she proceeded to cut the first seven &ldquo;heads&rdquo; of rice,
repeating &ldquo;the Ten Prayers&rdquo; as she did so. Then she put the
seven &ldquo;heads&rdquo; together, and <i>kissed</i> them; turned up
the whites of her eyes thrice, and thrice contracting the muscles of
her throat with a sort of &ldquo;click,&rdquo; swallowed the water in
her mouth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13647src" href="#xd21e13647"

anointed them with oil and tied them round with parti-coloured thread
(<i lang="ms">b&#277;nang panchawarna</i>), after which she fumigated
them with the incense, and strewing rice of each kind over them, folded
the ends of the cloth over them, and deposited them as before in the
basket, which was handed to the first bearer. Then standing up, she
strewed more rice over the sheaf, and tossing some backwards over her
head, threw the remainder over the rest of the party, saying
&ldquo;<i lang="ms">tabek</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;pardon&rdquo;) as she did
so, and exclaiming &ldquo;<i lang="ms">kur s&#277;mangat, kur
s&#277;mangat, kur s&#277;mangat!</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;cluck, cluck,
soul!&rdquo;) in a loud voice. Next she pushed the cocoa-nut shell
(which had contained the <i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>) into the
middle of the sheaf, and removed all traces of the lane which had been
trodden round the sheaf (to make it accessible) by bending down the
surrounding ears of rice until the gap was concealed.</p>
<p class="par">Then the First Bearer, slinging the basket of the
Rice-child about her neck (by means of the red cloth before referred
to), took an umbrella<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13698src" href=

opened it to shield the Rice-child from the effects of the sun, and
when the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> had reseated herself and repeated an
Arabic prayer (standing erect again at the end of it with her hands
clasped above her head), this part of the ceremony came to an end.
Moving on to another part of the field, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> now
cut the next seven &ldquo;heads&rdquo; and deposited them in one of the
three rice-baskets, which she then handed to one of the female bearers,
telling her and her two companions to reap the field in parallel
straight lines <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=

rice-baskets, after which they were to return to the house. Leaving the
three reapers at their task, I followed the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> and
Eldest Bearer (the latter still shielding the Rice-child from the sun
with the umbrella) and arrived in time to witness the reception of the
party as they reached the foot of the house-ladder. Here (on the
threshold) we were met by the wife of the owner, and other women of his
family, the former thrice calling out as we approached, &ldquo;<i lang=
"ms">Apa khabar?</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;What news?&rdquo;), and thrice
receiving the reply, &ldquo;<i lang="ms">Baik</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;It is
well&rdquo;). On receiving this reply for the third time she threw
saffron-rice over the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> and repeated these
lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

Finally, the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> removed the <i>sarongs</i> which

<i lang="ms">Tongkat Mandah</i>; it may be described as an ordinary
&ldquo;rice-head&rdquo; bending over to meet the tip of a second
(adventitious) &ldquo;rice-head,&rdquo; but it is produced only by a
freak of nature. There is some risk connected with this variety,
however, for if the &ldquo;Reception <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Princess&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">P&#365;tri B&#277;rtudong</i>); in this
case the sheath of the &ldquo;head&rdquo; is of unusual length, and
overshadows the &ldquo;head&rdquo; itself. A fourth kind is called
<i lang="ms">Padi B&#277;rtel&rsquo;kum</i>, and is described as a
&ldquo;Female Rice&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">padi b&#277;tina</i>); like the
&ldquo;Veiled Princess,&rdquo; it has an unusually well-developed
sheath; whilst a fifth kind is the &ldquo;<i lang="ms">Padi

markings.</p>

again before depositing their baskets on the ground. Their heads should
be covered, and they should always be careful to reap, as has been
said, facing the sun, <i>to prevent their shadow from falling upon the
rice in the basket at their side</i>. Occasionally, however, the body
is uncovered, and I was even told of one, Inche Fatimah of Jugra, in
Selangor, who when reaping stripped herself bare from the waist
upwards, and when asked why she did so said it was &ldquo;to make the
rice-husks thinner, as she was tired of pounding thick-husked
rice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The sheaf which is left standing after the taking home
of the Rice-soul is called the Mother of the Rice-soul (<i lang=

(<i lang="ms">isi niyor</i>) and what are called &ldquo;goat
flowers&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">bunga kambing</i>), mix them, and eat them

[So, after a birth (as the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> informed me), the
young shoots of the jack-fruit (<i lang="ms">kababal nangka</i>), the
rose-apple (<i lang="ms">jambu</i>), and certain kinds of banana (such
as <i lang="ms">pisang abu</i> and <i lang="ms">pisang

(<i lang="ms">asam</i>), prawn-condiment (<i lang=

salad (<i lang="ms">rojak</i>). For three successive days this salad is
administered to mother and child, the person who administers it saying,
if the child be a girl, &ldquo;Your mother is here, eat this
salad,&rdquo; and if the child be a boy, &ldquo;Your father is here,
eat this salad.&rdquo;]</p>

threshed out and mixed with the Rice-soul). The owner then takes the
Rice-soul and its basket and deposits it in the big circular rice-bin
used by the Malays, together with the product of the last sheaf. Some

CHARMS</h4>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the Western States of the Peninsula by far the
most important branch of industry has for many years been that of
Tin-mining. Though something like 90 per cent of the labourers employed
in the mines are Chinese, the ceremonies used at the opening of
tin-mines are purely Malay in character.</p>
<p class="par">The post of mining wizard, once a highly lucrative one,
was in past days almost always filled by a Malay, though occasionally
the services of a Jungle-man (<i lang="ms">Sakai</i>) would be
preferred. These mining wizards enjoyed in their palmy days an
extraordinary reputation, some of them being credited with the power of
bringing ore to a place where it was known that no ore existed; some,
too, were believed to possess the power of sterilising such ore as
existed, and of turning it into mere grains of sand.</p>
<p class="par">The ore itself is regarded as endued not only with
vitality, but also with the power of growth, ore of indifferent quality
being regarded as too young (<i lang="ms">muda</i>), but as likely to
improve with age. Sometimes, again, it is described as resembling a
buffalo, in which shape it is believed to make its way from place to
place underground. This idea, however, is probably based upon
traditions of a lode, though it is quite in keeping <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>with
Malay ideas about the spirits residing in other minerals, the Gold
spirit being supposed to take the shape of a <i lang="ms">kijang</i> or
roe-deer (whence the tradition of a golden roe-deer being found at Raub
in Pahang).</p>
<p class="par">In connection with the subject of tin-mining the account
contributed<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14132src" href="#xd21e14132"
name="xd21e14132src">224</a> in 1885 by Mr. Abraham Hale (then
Inspector of Mines in the Kinta district of Perak) to the <i>Journal of
the Straits Asiatic Society</i> is of such value as to necessitate its
being quoted <i lang="la">in extenso</i>. It will be followed by such
notes upon mining invocations as I was able to collect in Selangor,
after which a few remarks upon the Malay theory of animism in minerals
generally will bring the subject to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="par">To commence with Mr. Hale&rsquo;s
account:&mdash;&ldquo;The valley of the Kinta is, and has been for a
very long time, essentially a mining country. There are in the district
nearly five hundred registered mines, of which three are worked by
European Companies, the rest being either private mines, <i>i.e.</i>
mines claimed by Malays, which have been worked by them and their
ancestors for an indefinite period, or new mines, in other words new
concessions given indifferently on application to Malays and Chinese.
There are about three hundred and fifty private Malay mines, and it is
with these principally that the following paper will deal.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So far, no lodes have been discovered in Kinta;
it is, however, probable that, as the country is opened up and
prospectors get up amongst the spurs of the main range, the sources of
the stream tin will come to light.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mining in Kinta, like mining in L&acirc;rut, is
for stream tin, and this is found literally everywhere in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>Kinta; it is washed out of the sand in the
river-beds&mdash;a very favourite employment with Mandheling women;
Kinta natives do not affect it much, although there is more than one
stream where a good worker can earn a dollar per day; it is mined for
in the valley, and sluiced for on the sides of hills; and, lastly, a
very suggestive fact to a geologist, it has been found on the tops of
isolated limestone bluffs and in the caves<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14157src" href="#xd21e14157" name="xd21e14157src">225</a> which
some of them contain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This stream tin has probably been worked for
several centuries in Kinta; local tradition says that a very long time
ago Siamese were the principal miners, and there is evidence that very
extensive work has been done here by somebody at a time when the method
was different from that which is commonly adopted by Kinta Malays at
the present day. There are at least fifty deep well-like pits on the
Lahat hill, averaging about eight feet in diameter and perhaps twenty
feet deep.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Further up country I have seen a large pit which
the natives called a Siamese mine; this is about fifty feet in diameter
and over twenty feet deep, and its age may be conjectured from the
virgin forest in which it is situated. Besides these, at many places
extensive workings are continually brought to light as the country is
opened up, and these appear to have been left undisturbed for at least
a hundred years. Further evidence of old work is furnished by slabs of
tin of a shape unlike that which has been used in Perak in the memory
of living persons; and only a few weeks ago two very perfect
&lsquo;curry stones&rsquo; of an unusual shape and particularly sharp
grit were found at a depth of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253"
href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>eight feet in natural drift.
These may, perhaps, have been used to grind grain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So peculiarly is Kinta a mining district, that
even the Sakais of the hills do a little mining to get some tin sand
wherewith to buy the choppers and <i>sarongs</i> which the Malays sell
to them at an exorbitant price.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Malay <i lang="ms">pawang</i>, or
medicine-man, is probably the inheritor of various remnants and
traditions of the religion which preceded Muhammadanism, and in the
olden time this class of persons derived a very fair revenue from the
exercise of their profession, in propitiating and scaring those spirits
who have to do with mines and miners; even now, although the Malay
<i lang="ms">pawang</i> may squeeze a hundred or perhaps two hundred
dollars out of the Chinese <i lang="ms">towkay</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e14184src" href="#xd21e14184" name="xd21e14184src">226</a> who
comes to mine for tin in Malaya, the money is not perhaps badly
invested, for the Chinaman is no prospector, whereas a good Malay
<i lang="ms">pawang</i> has a wonderful &lsquo;nose&rsquo; for tin, and
it may be assumed that the Chinese <i lang="ms">towkay</i> and, before
his time, the Malay miner, would not pay a tax to the <i lang=
"ms">pawang</i> unless they had some ground for believing that, by
employing him and working under his advice, there would be more chance
of success than if they worked only on their own responsibility.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">pawang</i> being a person who
claims to have powers of divination and other imperfectly understood
attributes, endeavours to shroud his whole profession in more or less
of mystery. In his vocabulary, as in that of the gutta-hunters, special
terms are used to signify particular objects, the use of the ordinary
words being dropped; this is called &lsquo;<i lang="ms">bah&acirc;sa
pantang</i>.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14214src" href=

or must not be brought on to the actual works, for fear of damage to
the numerous races and dams; to name him, therefore, would displease
the spirits (<i lang="ms">hantu</i>).</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="ms">Ber-olak d&acirc;por</i>, instead of
<i lang="ms">kuching</i>&mdash;cat. Cats are not allowed on mines, nor
may the name be mentioned.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A tiger of enormous size called <i lang=
"ms">Ber-olak</i> is said to haunt Kinta. The legend about him is as
follows:&mdash; A long time ago, in the pre-Muhammadan days, a man
caught a tiger kitten and took it home; it grew up quite tame and lived
with the man until he died, when it returned to the jungle and grew to
an enormous size, nine cubits (<i lang="ms">hasta</i>) long; it is
still there, though nobody ever sees it; it does no harm, but sometimes
very large tracks are seen, and men hear its roar, which is so loud
that it can be heard from Ch&#277;mor to B&acirc;tu Gajah; when heard
in the dry season, it is a sure prognostication of rain in fifteen
days&rsquo; time.</p>

instead of <i lang="ms">limau nipis</i>&mdash;lime (fruit). If limes
are brought on to a mine, the <i lang="ms">hantu</i> (spirits) are said
to be offended; the particular feature of the fruit, which is
distasteful, appears to be its acidity. It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>is
peculiar that Chinese have this superstition concerning limes as well
as Malays; not very long ago a Chinese <i lang="ms">towkay</i> of a
mine complained that the men of a rival <i lang=

into his head race, and, furthermore, had rubbed their bodies with the
juice mixed with water out of his head race, and he said they had
committed a very grave offence, and asked that they might be punished
for it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;With Malays this appears to be one of the most
important <i lang="ms">pantang</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e14307src"
href="#xd21e14307" name="xd21e14307src">232</a> rules, and to such a
length is it carried that <i lang="ms">b&#277;lachan</i> (shrimp-paste)
is not allowed to be brought on to a mine for fear it should induce

<p class="par">&ldquo;17. On the death of any miner, each of his
comrades on that mine pays to the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> one <i lang=

<p class="par">&ldquo;It will be noticed that the amount of the
majority of these fines is $12.50; this is half of the amount of the
fine which, under the Malay customary law, a chief could impose on a
<i lang="ms">ra&#703;iyat</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e14705src"
href="#xd21e14705" name="xd21e14705src">244</a> for minor offences. It
is also the amount of the customary dowry in the case of a marriage
with a slave or with the widow or divorced wife of a <i lang=
"ms">ra&#703;iyat</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Malay miner has peculiar ideas about tin and
its properties; in the first instance, he believes that it is under the
protection and command of certain spirits whom he considers it
necessary to propitiate; next he considers that the tin itself is alive
and has many of the properties of living matter, that of its own
volition it can move from place to place, that it can reproduce itself,
and that it has special likes&mdash;or perhaps affinities&mdash;for
certain people and things, and <i>vice versa</i>. Hence it is advisable
to treat tin-ore with a certain amount of respect, to consult its
convenience, and what is, perhaps, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260"
href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>more curious, to conduct the
business of mining in such a way that the tin-ore may, as it were, be
obtained without its own knowledge!&rdquo;</p>

platform of round peeled sticks, about 1 foot 3 inches each way, is

fixed round three sides of the square, and from the open side a ladder
with four steps reaches down to the ground; the railing is carried down

<p class="par">The following notes on tin-mining in Selangor were
contributed to the <i>Selangor Journal</i> by Mr. J. C. Pasqual, a
well-known local miner:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Malay mining <i lang="ms">pawang</i> will
soon be a thing of the past, and many a <i lang="ms">pawang</i> has
returned to tilling the soil in place of his less legitimate occupation
of imposing upon the credulity of the miners. The reason for this is
not far to seek, as the Malay miner, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>as well as the
Chinese miner, of the old school, with their thousand-and-one
superstitions, has given place to a more modern and matter-of-fact
race, who place more reliance for prospecting purposes on boring tools
than on the divination and <i lang="ms">jampi</i> of the <i lang=
"ms">pawang</i>. But the profession of the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> has
not altogether died out, as he is sometimes called into requisition for
the purpose of casting out evil spirits from the mines; of converting
<i lang="ms">amang</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e14882src" href=
"#xd21e14882" name="xd21e14882src">253</a> (pyrites) into tin-ore, and
of invoking the spirits of a mine previous to the breaking of the first
sod in a new venture. These ceremonies generally involve the slaying of
a buffalo, a goat, or fowls, and the offering of betel-leaf, incense,
and rice, according to the means of the <i lang="ms">towkay
lombong</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The term <i lang="ms">pawang</i> is now used by
the Chinese to indicate the &lsquo;smelter&rsquo; (Chinese) of a mine
(probably from the fact that this office was formerly the monopoly of
the Malay <i lang="ms">pawang</i>).</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To the <i>pawangs</i> are attributed
extraordinary powers, for besides inducing tin-ore to continue or
become plentiful in a mine, he can cause its disappearance from a rich
&lsquo;claim&rsquo; by the inevitable <i lang="ms">jampi</i>, this
latter resource being resorted to by way of revenge in cases where the
<i lang="ms">towkay lombong</i> (or <i>labor</i>) fails to carry out
his pecuniary obligation towards the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> whose aid
he had invoked in less prosperous times. Some of the stories told of
the prowess of <i lang="ms">pawangs</i> are very ridiculous; for
instance, a native lady in Ulu Langat (for women are also credited with
the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> attributes), who was the <i lang=
"ms">pawang</i> of Sungei Jelok in Kajang, could command a grain of
tin-ore <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>to crawl on the palm of her hand <i>like a live
worm</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14935src" href="#xd21e14935" name=
"xd21e14935src">254</a> The failure of the Sungei Jelok mines was
attributed to her displeasure on account of an alleged breach of
contract on the part of the <i lang="ms">towkay lombong</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The term <i lang="ms">pawang</i> is sometimes
used as a verb in the sense of &lsquo;to prospect&rsquo; a <i lang=
"ms">sungei</i> or stream; thus in alluding to certain streams or
mines, it is not uncommon to hear a Malay say that they have been
prospected (<i lang="ms">sudah di-pawangkan</i>) by &lsquo;Inche&rsquo;
So-and-so&mdash;meaning that the stream had been discovered and proved
by a <i lang="ms">pawang</i> prior to the opening of the
mines.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14959src" href="#xd21e14959"
name="xd21e14959src">255</a></p>
<p class="par">In a later article Mr. Pasqual says: &ldquo;It is
believed that tin will even on rare occasions announce its presence by
a peculiar noise heard in the stillness of night, and that some birds
and insects by their chirrupings and whirrings will proclaim its
whereabouts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14966src" href=
"#xd21e14966" name="xd21e14966src">256</a></p>
<p class="par">In a still later article, after briefly referring to the
use of the <i lang="ms">bhasa pantang</i>, or &ldquo;Taboo
Language,&rdquo; by tin-miners in Selangor, Mr. Pasqual
proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are, again, certain acts which are
forbidden. In the mine, especially if the <i lang=
"ms">karang</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e14980src" href="#xd21e14980"
name="xd21e14980src">257</a> has not yet been removed, it is forbidden
to wear shoes or carry an umbrella. This rule, it seems, originated
with the coolies themselves, who in olden times insisted that the
<i lang="ms">Towkay Labur</i> should take off his shoes and close his
umbrella whenever he visited the mine, so that, as they alleged, the
spirits might not be offended. But their real object was not to allow
him to pry too much into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href=
"#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>the mine, in case it might not
bear scrutiny; and thus, by depriving him of the protection from the
sun and from the rough mining quartz which would have been afforded by
the umbrella and shoes, they prevented him from going about here,
there, and everywhere, and making unpleasant inquiries, as he would
otherwise have liked to do.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quarrelling and fighting in the mine is strictly
forbidden, as it has a tendency to drive away the ore.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bathing in the mine is not allowed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A man must not work in the mine with only his
bathing-cloth around his body. He must wear trousers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If a man takes off his sun hat and puts it on the
ground, he must turn it over and let it rest upon its crown.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Limes cannot be brought into the mine. This
superstition is peculiar to the Malay miner, who has a special dread of
this fruit, which, in <i lang="ms">pantang</i> language, he calls
<i lang="ms">salah nama</i> (lit. &lsquo;wrong name&rsquo;) instead of
<i lang="ms">limau nipis</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In looking at the check-roll it is forbidden to
point at the names with the finger. No one may examine the check-roll
at night with an open light, owing more probably to the fear of setting
it on fire than to superstitious prejudices.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is considered unlucky for a man to fall off
the mining ladder, for, whether he is hurt or not, he is likely to die
within the year.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An outbreak of fire in the mine is considered an
omen of prosperity. Several mines have been known to double or treble
their output of tin after the occurrence of a fire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is unlucky for a coolie to die in the <i lang=
"ms">kongsi</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265"
name="pb265">265</a>]</span>house. When, therefore, a man is very sick
and past all hopes of recovery, it is customary to put him out of the
house in an extempore hut erected in the scrub, so that death may not
take place in the <i lang="ms">kongsi</i> amongst the living. His
<i lang="ms">chuleis</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e15028src" href=
"#xd21e15028" name="xd21e15028src">258</a> attend him during his last
hours and bury him when dead. These and other superstitious ideas and
observances are, however, fast dying out, though it would still be an
unsafe experiment to enter a mine with shoes on and an umbrella over
your head.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15033src" href=
"#xd21e15033" name="xd21e15033src">259</a></p>
<p class="par">The remaining notes on mining ceremonies and charms were
collected by me in Selangor. On reaching the tin-bearing stratum, the
tin-ore is addressed by name:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Peace be with you, O Tin-Ore,</p>
<p class="line">At the first it was dew that turned into water,</p>
<p class="line">And water that turned into foam,</p>
<p class="line">And foam that turned into rock,</p>
<p class="line">And rock that turned into tin-ore;</p>
<p class="line">Do you, O Tin-Ore, lying in a matrix of solid rock,</p>
<p class="line">Come forth from this matrix of solid rock;</p>
<p class="line">If you do not come forth</p>
<p class="line">You shall be a rebel in the sight of God.</p>
<p class="line">Ho, Tin-Ore, Sir &lsquo;Floating Islet,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;Flotsam-at-sea,&rsquo; and

<p class="line">Or you shall be a rebel to God,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Sometimes each grain of ore appears to be
considered as endowed with a separate entity or individuality. Thus we
find in another invocation the following passage, where the wizard is
addressing the grains of ore:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Do You (Grains of Ore) that are on the Hills
descend to the Plains,</p>
<p class="line">You that are at the Head-waters descend to
Mid-stream,</p>
<p class="line">You that are at the Estuary ascend to Mid-stream.</p>
<p class="line">And <i>assemble yourselves together</i> in this

<p class="line">Assemble ye together in this spot.</p>
<p class="line">I am desirous of excavating this spot,</p>
<p class="line">And of making a mine here;</p>
<p class="line">If ye do not assemble yourselves together</p>
<p class="line">I shall curse you;</p>
<p class="line">You shall be turned into dust, and turned into air,</p>
<p class="line">And you shall also be turned into water.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The separate personality of each individual grain
is remarkably clear in the above passage. The names of the different
kinds of seed are in allusion to the various shapes and sizes of the
grains of ore.</p>
<p class="par">Yet in the very same charm various kinds of lizards and
centipedes are begged to &ldquo;bring the tin-ore with them, some of
them a grain or two, some of them a fistful or two, some of them a
gallon or two, some of them a load or two,&rdquo; and so on. No doubt
the wizard was determined to allow the grains no loophole for
escape.</p>
<p class="par">The objects of the charms employed by the mining wizards
are the following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">(1) To clear the jungle of evil spirits (and propitiate
the good ones?) before starting to fell, as is shown by the following
passage:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">(4) To induce the spirits to partake of a banquet which
is spread for them in a receptacle intended to be the model of a royal
audience-chamber.</p>
<p class="par">This, the &ldquo;spirits&rsquo; audience-chamber&rdquo;
(as it is called), is usually from two to three feet square, and is
filled with offerings similar in character to those usually deposited
on the sacrificial tray (<i lang="ms">anchak</i>), with the addition,
however, of certain articles which are considered to be specially
representative of the miners&rsquo; food. These articles are
sugar-cane, plantains, yams, sweet potatoes, and fish, etc.; all of
which should be placed together with the customary offerings in the
&ldquo;spirits&rsquo; audience-chamber.&rdquo; Outside the
&ldquo;audience-hall,&rdquo; at each of the two front corners, should
be placed a red and a white flag and a wax taper; and at each of the
two back corners should be placed a taper, making in all four flags and
seven tapers.</p>
<p class="par">A standard censer (<i lang="ms">p&#277;rasapan</i>) must
be erected in front of the &ldquo;audience-chamber,&rdquo; and a second
small censer must also be obtained, so that burning incense may be
&ldquo;waved&rdquo; to and fro underneath the floor of the
audience-chamber in order to fumigate it before the offerings are
deposited inside it.</p>
<p class="par">During the fumigation a charm is recited, in which the
assistance of the spirits of certain canonized Muhammadan worthies is
invoked, concluding thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="par first">Then when the tapers are all lighted and the
offerings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=

as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ho, White Sheikh, king of the virgin jungle,</p>

</div>
<p class="par first">The chief taboos are the killing of any sort of
living creature within the mine; to wear a <i lang="ms">sarong</i>
(Malay skirt); to bring into the mine the skin of any beast; and to
wear shoes or use an umbrella within the mine. These are some of the
perpetual taboos, but no doubt there are many others.</p>
<p class="par">In the case of a sacrifice, however, the white buffalo
may of course be killed, not within the mine itself, but still upon its
brink; and when this is done, the head is buried, and small portions
(which must be &ldquo;representative&rdquo; of every part of the
carcase) should be taken and deposited in the
&ldquo;audience-chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Among the seven days&rsquo; taboos are mentioned the
killing of any living timber (within the precincts of the mine?),
lewdness, and the praising or admiring of the &ldquo;grass seed&rdquo;
(<i lang="ms">puji buah rumput</i>), which is the name by which the
tin-ore must invariably be called within the precincts of the mine.
This last taboo is due to the use of a special mining vocabulary to
which the greatest attention was formerly paid, and which did not
differ very greatly from that used in Perak. <span class=

</div>
<p class="par first">The foregoing descriptions of mining ceremonies
and charms refer to tin only, but in so far as general animistic ideas
go, they might be equally well applied to other metals, such as silver
and gold.</p>
<p class="par">It has already been remarked that as the Tin spirit is
believed to take the form of a buffalo, so the Gold spirit is said to
take the form of a golden roe-deer (<i lang="ms">kijang</i>). Of the
ceremonies which the Malays believe to be essential for successful
gold-mining, not much information has yet been published. In
Denys&rsquo; <i>Descriptive Dictionary</i>, however, we read the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Gold is believed to be under the care and in the
gift of a <i lang="ms">dewa</i>, or god, and its search is therefore
unhallowed, for the miners must conciliate the <i lang="ms">dewa</i> by
prayers and offerings, and carefully abstain from pronouncing the name
of God or performing any act of worship. Any acknowledgment of the
sovereignty of <i>Allah</i> offends the <i lang="ms">dewa,</i> who
immediately &lsquo;hides the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>gold,&rsquo; or renders it
invisible. At some of the great <i lang="ms">limbongan<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15474src" href="#xd21e15474" name=
"xd21e15474src">269</a> mas</i> or gold-pits in the Malay States of the
interior, any allusion to the Deity subjects the unwitting miner to a
penalty which is imposed by the <i lang="ms">Pengh&ucirc;lu</i>. The
qualities of the gold vary greatly in the same country. The finest gold
brought to market is that of the principality of Pahang, on the eastern
side of the Malay Peninsula, which brings a higher price than even that
of Australia by better than three per cent. The gold is all obtained by
washing, and the metal has never been worked, and scarcely even traced
to the original veins. It is mostly in the form of powder or
dust&mdash;the <i lang="ms">mas-urai</i> of the Malays, literally
&lsquo;loose or disintegrated gold.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15489src" href="#xd21e15489" name="xd21e15489src">270</a></p>
<p class="par">Gold, silver, and an amalgam formed of the two, are
regarded as the three most precious metals, and of these gold is, to a
very uncertain and partial extent, still sometimes regarded as a royal
prerogative.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15500src" href="#xd21e15500"
name="xd21e15500src">271</a></p>
<p class="par">Of Silver still less information has been collected than
of gold. This, however, is but natural, as silver has not yet been
found in payable quantities, whereas many gold mines exist. It is just
possible, however, that silver may be worked by the Malays on a small
scale in the Siamese-Malay States, as it would be difficult on any
other hypothesis to account for the following invocation, which was
given me by a Malay of Kelantan (&rsquo;Che &#703;Abas):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Peace be with you, O Child of the Solitary Jin

</div>
<p class="par first">No other metals, so far as I am aware, are worked
to any extent in the Peninsula, yet there is the clearest possible
evidence of animistic ideas about Iron. Thus for the Sacred Lump of
Iron which forms part of the regalia of more than one of the petty
Sultans in the Peninsula, the Malays entertain the most extraordinary
reverence, not unmingled with superstitious terror.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e15556src" href="#xd21e15556" name="xd21e15556src">272</a> It
is upon this &ldquo;Lump of Iron,&rdquo; when placed in water, that the
most solemn and binding oath known to those who make use of it is
sworn; and it is to this &ldquo;Lump of Iron&rdquo; that the Malay
wizard refers when he recites his category of the most terrible
denunciations that Malay magic has been able to invent.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15587src" href="#xd21e15587" name=
"xd21e15587src">273</a></p>
<p class="par">It is possible that there may be, in the Malay
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>mind at all events, some connection between the
supernatural powers ascribed to this portion of the regalia and the
more general use of iron as a charm against evil spirits. For the
various forms of iron which play so conspicuous a part in Malay magic,
from the long iron nail which equally protects the new-born infant and
the Rice-Soul from the powers of evil, to the betel-nut scissors which
are believed to scare the evil spirits from the dead, are alike called
the representatives (symbols or emblems) of Iron (<i lang="ms">tanda
b&#277;si</i>). So, too, is the blade of the wood-knife, or cutlass,
which a jungle Malay will sometimes plant in the bed of a stream (with
its edge towards the source) before he will venture to drink of the
water. So, too, is the blade of the same knife, upon the side of which
he will occasionally seat himself when he is eating alone in the
forest; both of these precautions being taken, however, as I have more
than once been told, not only to drive away evil spirits, but to
&ldquo;confirm&rdquo; the speaker&rsquo;s own soul (<i lang=
"ms">m&#277;n&#277;tapkan s&#277;mangat</i>).</p>
<p class="par">Even Stone appears to be regarded as distinctly
connected with ideas of animism. Thus the stone deposited in the basket
with the Rice-soul, the stone deposited in the child&rsquo;s swinging
cot by way of a substitute when the child is temporarily taken out of
it, and above all the various concretions to be found from time to time
both in the bodies of animals (&ldquo;Bezoar&rdquo; stones) and in the
stems or fruit of trees (as <i lang="ms">tabasheer</i>), are examples
of this. Examples of <i lang="ms">tabasheer</i> have already been
quoted (under Vegetation Charms), but a few remarks about Bezoar stones
may be of interest.</p>
<p class="par">The Bezoar stones known to the Peninsular Malays are
usually obtained either from monkeys or porcupines. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>Extraordinary magical virtues are attached to
these stones, the gratings of which are mixed with water and
administered to the sick.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15615src" href=
"#xd21e15615" name="xd21e15615src">274</a></p>
<p class="par">I was once asked $200 for a small stone which its owner
kept in cotton-wool in a small tin box, where it lay surrounded by
grains of rice, upon which he declared that it fed.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e15626src" href="#xd21e15626" name="xd21e15626src">275</a> I
asked him how it could be proved that it was a true Bezoar stone (which
it undoubtedly was not), and he declared that if it were placed upon an
inverted tumbler and touched with the point of a <i lang=
"ms">k&rsquo;ris</i> (dagger) or a lime-fruit it would commence to move
about. Both tests were therefore applied in my presence, but the motion
of the Bezoar stone in each case proved to be due to the most overt
trickery on the part of the owner, who by pressing on one side of the
stone (which was spherical in shape) naturally caused it to move; in
fact I was easily able to produce the same effect in the same way, as I
presently showed him, though of course he could not be brought to admit
the deception.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15647src" href="#xd21e15647"

<p class="par">Before I leave this portion of the subject, I may
mention that magic powers are very generally ascribed to the
&ldquo;celts&rdquo; or &ldquo;stone-age&rdquo; implements which are
frequently found in the Peninsula, and are called thunderbolts
(<i lang="ms">batu halilintar</i>). They are not unfrequently grated
and mixed with water and drunk <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277"

<p class="par first">The following description (by Sir W. E. Maxwell)
of the bathing ceremony, as practised by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>Perak Malays, may be taken as typical of this
subject:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Limes are used in Perak, as we use soap, when a
Malay has resolved on having a really good &ldquo;scrub.&rdquo; They
are cut in two and squeezed (<i lang="ms">ramas</i>) in the hand. In
Penang a root called <i lang="ms">sintok</i> is usually preferred to
limes. When the body is deemed sufficiently cleansed the performer,
taking his stand facing the East, spits seven times, and then counts up
seven aloud. After the word <i lang="ms">tujoh</i> (seven) he throws
away the remains of the limes or <i lang="ms">sintok</i> to the West,
saying aloud, <i lang="ms">Pergi-lah samua sial jambalang deripada
badan aku ka pusat tasek Paujangi</i>, &lsquo;Misfortune and spirits of
evil begone from my body to the whirlpool of the lake Paujangi!&rsquo;
Then he throws (<i lang="ms">jurus</i>) a few buckets of water over
himself, and the operation is complete.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The lake Paujangi is situated in mid-ocean, and
its whirlpool most likely causes the tides. All the waters of the sea
and rivers are finally received there. It is probably as eligible an
abode for exorcised spirits as the Red Sea was once considered to be by
our forefathers.&rdquo; <a class="noteref" id="xd21e15777src" href=
"#xd21e15777" name="xd21e15777src">277</a></p>
<p class="par">The ceremony just described is evidently a form of
purification by water. Similar purificatory ceremonies form an integral
part of Malay customs at birth, adolescence, marriage, sickness, death,
and in fact at every critical period of the life of a Malay; but will
be most conveniently discussed in detail under each of the particular
headings referred to. The <i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i> ceremony
(for the details of which <i>see</i> <a href="#ch3">Chapter III.</a>,
and which is perhaps the commonest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279"
href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>of all Malay magic rites)
would also seem to have originated from ideas of ceremonial
purification.</p>

<h4 class="main"><span class="divNum">2.</span> THE SEA, RIVERS, AND
STREAMS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Malays have been from time immemorial a
sea-faring race, and are quite as superstitious in their ideas of the
sea as sailors in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="par">As has been already indicated,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15813src" href="#xd21e15813" name="xd21e15813src">278</a> their
animistic notions include a belief in Water Spirits, both of the sea
and of rivers, and occasionally this belief finds expression in ritual
observances.</p>
<p class="par">Thus, for instance, it was formerly the custom to insert
a number of sugar-palm twigs (<i lang="ms">s&#277;gar kabong</i>) into
the top of the ship&rsquo;s mast, making the end of it look not unlike
a small birch of black twigs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15829src"
href="#xd21e15829" name="xd21e15829src">279</a></p>
<p class="par">This was intended to prevent the Water Spirit (<i lang=
"ms">Hantu Ayer</i>) from settling on the mast. His appearance when he
does settle is described as resembling the glow of fire flies or of
phosphorescence in the sea&mdash;evidently a form of St. Elmo&rsquo;s
fire.</p>
<p class="par">The ship being a living organism, one must, of course,
when all is ready, persuade it to make a proper start. To effect this
you go on board, and sitting down beside the well (<i lang="ms">petak
ruang</i>), burn incense and strew the sacrificial rice, and then
tapping the inside of the keelson (<i lang="ms">jintekkan
s&#277;r&#277;mpu</i>) and the next plank above it (<i lang="ms">apit
l&#277;mpong</i>), beg them to adhere to each other during the voyage,
<i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Peace be with you, O &lsquo;big
M&#277;dang&rsquo; and &lsquo;low-growing M&#277;dang!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="line">I desire you to speed me, to the utmost of your
power,</p>
<p class="line">To <i>such and such a place</i>;</p>
<p class="line">If ye will not, ye shall be rebels against God,&rdquo;
etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">I need hardly explain, perhaps, that &ldquo;big
<i lang="ms">m&#277;dang</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;low-growing <i lang=
"ms">m&#277;dang</i>&rdquo; are the names of two varieties of the same
tree, which are supposed in the present instance to have furnished the
timber from which these different parts were made.</p>
<p class="par">Then you stand up in the bows and call upon the Sea
Spirits for their assistance in pointing out shoals, snags, and rocky
islets.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15882src" href="#xd21e15882" name=
"xd21e15882src">280</a></p>
<p class="par">Sometimes a talisman is manufactured by writing an
Arabic text on a leaf which is then thrown into the sea.</p>
<p class="par">So, too, it is not unusual to see rocks in mid-stream
near the mouths of rivers adorned with a white cloth hanging from a
long stick or pole, which marks them out as &ldquo;sacred
places,&rdquo; and sometimes in rapids where navigation is difficult or
dangerous, offerings are made to the River Spirits, as the following
quotation will show:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We commenced at last to slide down a long reach
of troubled water perceptibly out of the horizontal. The raft buried
itself under the surface, leaving dry only our little stage, and the
whole fabric shook and trembled as if it were about to break up.
Yelling &lsquo;<i lang="ms">Sambut, sambut</i>&rsquo; (&lsquo;Receive,

propitiating with small offerings of rice and leaves, the panting
boatmen continued their struggles until we shot out once more into
smooth deep water, and all danger was over.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The importance of rivers in the Malay Peninsula, and for
that matter, in Malayan countries generally, can hardly be overrated.
It was by the rivers that Malay immigration, coming for the most part,
if not entirely, from Sumatra, entered the interior of the Peninsula,
and before the influx of Europeans had superseded them by roads and
railways the rivers were the sole means of inland communication. All
old Malay settlements are situated on the banks of rivers or streams,
both on this account and because of the necessity of having a plentiful
supply of water for the purpose of irrigating the rice-fields, which
constitute the main source of livelihood for the inhabitants.</p>
<p class="par">Accordingly the backbone, so to speak, of a Malay
district is the river that runs through it, and from which in most
cases the district takes its name; for here, as elsewhere, the
river-names are generally older than the names of territorial
divisions. They are often unintelligible and probably of pre-Malayan
origin, but are sometimes derived from the Malay names of forest trees.
As a rule every reach and point has a name known to the local Malays,
even though the river may run through forest and swamp with only a few
villages scattered at intervals of several miles along its banks.</p>
<p class="par">Of river legends there are not a few. The following
extract relates to one of the largest rivers of the Peninsula, the
river Perak, which gives its name to the largest and most important of
the Malay States of the West Coast. <i lang="ms">Perak</i> means
silver, though none is mined in the country; and the legend is a fair
specimen of the sort of story which grows up round an attempt to
account for an otherwise inexplicable name:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On their return down-stream, the Raja and his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>followers halted at Chigar Galah, where a small
stream runs into the river Perak. They were struck with astonishment at
finding the water of this stream as white as <i lang="ms">santan</i>
(the grated pulp of the cocoa-nut mixed with water). Magat Terawis, who
was despatched to the source of the stream to discover the cause of
this phenomenon, found there a large fish of the kind called <i lang=

breasts from which milk issued.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15928src"

<h5 class="main"><i>The Crocodile</i></h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Of the origin of the Crocodile two conflicting
stories, at least, are told. One of these was collected by Sir William
Maxwell in Perak; the other was taken down by me from a Labu Malay in
Selangor, but I have not met with it elsewhere; a parallel version of
the story quoted by Maxwell being the commonest form of the legend in
Selangor as well as Perak.</p>
<p class="par">Sir William Maxwell&rsquo;s account runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the case of the crocodile, we find an instance
of a dangerous animal being regarded by Malays as possessed of
mysterious powers, which distinguish <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>him from most of the
brute creation, and class him with the tiger and elephant. Just as in
some parts of India sacred crocodiles are protected and fed in tanks
set apart for them by Hindus, so in Malay rivers here and there
particular crocodiles are considered <i lang="ms">kramat</i> (sacred),
and are safe from molestation. On a river in the interior of Malacca I
have had my gun-barrels knocked up when taking aim at a crocodile, the
Malay who did it immediately falling on his knees in the bottom of the
boat and entreating forgiveness, on the ground that the individual
reptile aimed at was <i lang="ms">kramat</i>, and that the
speaker&rsquo;s family would not be safe if it were injured. The source
of ideas like this lies far deeper in the Malay mind than his
Muhammadanism; but the new creed has, in many instances, appropriated
and accounted for them. The connection of the tiger with Ali, the uncle
of the prophet, has already been explained. A grosser Muhammadan fable
has been invented regarding the crocodile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This reptile, say the P&ecirc;rak Malays, was
first created in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There was once upon a time a woman called Putri
Padang Gerinsing, whose petitions found great favour and acceptance
with the Almighty.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She it was who had the care of Siti Fatima, the
daughter of the Prophet. One day she took some clay and fashioned it
into the likeness of what is now the crocodile. The material on which
she moulded the clay was a sheet of <i lang="ms">upih</i> (the sheath
of the betel-nut palm). This became the covering of the
crocodile&rsquo;s under-surface. When she attempted to make the mass
breathe it broke in pieces. This happened twice. Now it chanced that
the Tuan Putri had just <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>been eating sugar-cane, so she
arranged a number of sugar-cane joints to serve as a backbone, and the
peelings of the rind she utilised as ribs. On its head she placed a
sharp stone, and she made eyes out of bits of saffron (<i lang=
"ms">kuniet</i>); the tail was made of the mid-rib and leaves of a
betel-nut frond. She prayed to God Almighty that the creature might
have life, and it at once commenced to breathe and move. For a long
time it was a plaything of the Prophet&rsquo;s daughter, Siti Fatima;
but it at length became treacherous and faithless to Tuan Putri Padang
Gerinsing, who had grown old and feeble. Then Fatima cursed it, saying,
&lsquo;Thou shalt be the crocodile of the sea, no enjoyment shall be
thine, and thou shalt not know lust or desire.&rsquo; She then deprived
it of its teeth and tongue, and drove nails into its jaws to close
them. It is these nails which serve the crocodile as teeth to this day.
Malay Pawangs in P&ecirc;rak observe the following methods of
proceeding when it is desired to hook a crocodile:&mdash;To commence
with, a white fowl must be slain in the orthodox way, by cutting its
throat, and some of its blood must be rubbed on the line (usually
formed of rattan) to which the fowl itself is attached as bait. The
dying struggles of the fowl in the water are closely watched, and
conclusions are drawn from them as to the probable behaviour of the
crocodile when hooked. If the fowl goes to a considerable distance the
crocodile will most likely endeavour to make off; but it will be
otherwise if the fowl moves a little way only up and down or across the
stream.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When the line is set the following spell must be
repeated: &lsquo;<i lang="ms">Aur Dangsari kamala sari, sambut kirim

As the bait is thrown into the water the operator must blow on it three
times, stroke it three times, and thrice repeat the following sentence,
with his teeth closed and without drawing breath: &lsquo;<i lang=

<p class="par">The rarer story, to which allusion has been made, was
the following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There was a woman who had a child which had just
learnt to sit up (<i lang="ms">tahu dudok</i>), and to which she gave
the name of &lsquo;Sarilang.&rsquo; One day she took the child to the
river-side in order to bathe it, but during the latter operation it
slipped from her grasp and fell into the river. The mother shrieked and
wept, but as she did not know how to dive she had to return home
without her child. That night she dreamed a dream, in which her child
appeared and said, &lsquo;Weep no more, mother, I have turned into a
crocodile, and am now called &lsquo;Grandsire Sarilang&rsquo;
(&rsquo;Toh Sarilang): if you would meet me, come to-morrow to the spot
where you lost me.&rsquo; Next morning, therefore, the mother repaired
to the river and called upon the name of her child, whereupon her child
rose to the surface, and she saw that from the waist downwards he had
already turned into a crocodile, though he was still human down to the
waist. Now the child said, &lsquo;Come back again after fourteen days,
and remember to bring an egg and a plantain (banana).&rsquo; She
therefore went <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>again at the time appointed, and having called
upon him by his new name (&rsquo;Toh Sarilang), he again came to the
surface, when she saw that from the waist upwards he had also now
turned into a crocodile. So she gave him the egg and the plantain, and
he devoured them, and when he had done so he said, &lsquo;Whenever the
crocodiles get ferocious (<i lang="ms">ganas</i>), and commence to
attack human beings, take a plantain, an egg, and a handful of parched
rice, and after scattering the rice on the river, leave the egg and the
plantain on the bank, calling upon my name (&rsquo;Toh
Sarilang)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16024src" href="#xd21e16024" name=
"xd21e16024src">285</a> as you do so, and their ferocity will
immediately cease.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The notes on crocodile folklore which will now be given
were reprinted in the <i>Selangor Journal</i> from the &ldquo;Perak
Museum Notes&rdquo; of Mr. Wray.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When the eggs of a crocodile are hatching out,
the mother watches; the little ones that take to their native element
she does not molest, but she eats up all those which run away from the
water, but should any escape her and get away on to the land they will
change into tigers. Some of these reptiles are said to have tongues,
and when possessed of that organ they are very much more vicious and
dangerous than the ordinarily formed ones. When a crocodile enters a
river it swallows a pebble, so that on opening the stomach of one it is
only necessary to count the stones in it to tell how many rivers it has
been into during its life. The Malays call these stones <i lang=
"ms">kira-kira dia</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16038src" href=
"#xd21e16038" name="xd21e16038src">286</a> on this account. The Indians
on the banks of the Orinoco, on the other hand, assert that the
alligator swallows stones to add weight to its body to aid it in diving
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>dragging its prey under water. Crocodiles
inhabiting a river are said to resent the intrusion of strangers from
other waters, and fights often take place in consequence. According to
the Malays they are gifted with two pairs of eyes. The upper ones they
use when above water, and the under pair when beneath the surface. This
latter pair is situated half-way between the muzzle and the angle of
the mouth, on the under surface of the lower jaw. These are in reality
not eyes, but inward folds of skin connected by a duct with a scent
gland, which secretes an unctuous substance of a dark gray colour, with
a strong musky odour. Medicinal properties are attributed to the flesh
of the males, which are believed to be of very rare occurrence, and to
be quite unable to leave the water by reason of their peculiar
conformation. The fact is that the sexes are almost undistinguishable,
except on dissection, and therefore the natives class all that are
caught as females. While on this subject, it may be worth mentioning
that at Port Weld there used to be a tame crocodile which would come
when called. The Malays fed it regularly, and said it was not vicious,
and would not do any harm. It was repeatedly seen by the yearly
visitants to Port Weld, or Sapetang, as the place was then called, and
was a fine big animal, with a bunch of seaweed growing on its head.
Some one had it called, and then fired at the poor thing; whether it
was wounded or only frightened is uncertain, but it never came
again.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16045src" href="#xd21e16045"
name="xd21e16045src">287</a></p>
<p class="par">The following notes upon the same subject were collected
by me in Selangor:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">The female crocodile commonly builds her nest, with or
without the aid of the male, among the thorny <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>clumps of <i lang="ms">l&#277;mpiei</i> (or
<i lang="ms">d&#277;mpiei</i>) trees just above high-water mark, using
the fallen leaves to form the nest, and breaking up the twigs with her
mouth. The season for laying is said, in the north of the Peninsula, to
coincide with the time &ldquo;when the rice-stalks swell with the
grain,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the end of the wet season.</p>
<p class="par">The most prolific species of crocodile is reputed to be
the <i lang="ms">buaya lubok</i>, or Bight crocodile (also called
<i lang="ms">buaya rawang</i>, or Marsh crocodile), which lays as many
as fifty or sixty eggs in a single nest. Other varieties, I may add,
are the <i lang="ms">buaya t&#277;mbaga</i> (Copper crocodile), the
<i lang="ms">buaya katak</i> (Dwarf crocodile), which is, as its name
implies, &ldquo;short and stout,&rdquo; and the <i lang="ms">buaya
hitam</i> or <i lang="ms">b&#277;si</i> (Black or Iron crocodile),
which is reported to attain a larger size than any other variety. This
latter kind is often moss-grown, and is hence called <i lang="ms">buaya
b&#277;rlumut</i> (Mossy crocodile). The largest specimen of this
variety of which I have had any reliable account is one which measured
&ldquo;four fathoms, less one <i lang="ms">hasta</i>&rdquo; (about 23
feet), and which was caught in the time of Sultan Mahmat at Sungei
Sembilang, near Kuala Selangor, by one Nakhoda Kutib.</p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="ms">buaya jolong-jolong</i>, which has
attracted attention owing to its reputed identification with the gavial
of Indian waters, and which is therefore no true crocodile, is
pointedly described by Malays as separating itself from the other
species.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, there is the <i lang="ms">buaya gulong
t&#277;nun</i> (the &ldquo;Crocodile that Rolls up the Weft&rdquo;?),
which is not, however, the name of a separate variety, but is the name
applied to the Young Person or New Woman of the world of
crocodile-folk&mdash;the aggressive female who &ldquo;snaps&rdquo; at
everything and everybody for the mere glory of the snap!<a id=
"xd21e16102" name="xd21e16102"></a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;After hatching,&rdquo; says Mr. Wray, &ldquo;the
mother watches, and ... eats up all those which run away from the
water, but should any escape her and get away on to the land they will
turn into tigers.&rdquo; There is perhaps more point in the Selangor
tradition, according to which the little runaways turn, not into
tigers, but into &ldquo;iguanas&rdquo; (Monitor lizards).</p>
<p class="par">As regards the want of a tongue, which is supposed to be
common to all crocodiles, it is said they were so created by design, in
order that they might not acquire too pronounced a &ldquo;taste&rdquo;
for human flesh. Hence the proverb which declares that no carrion is
too bad for them to welcome: &ldquo;<i lang="ms">Buaya mana tahu
m&#277;nolak bangkei?</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;When will crocodiles refuse
corpses?&rdquo;)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16112src" href=
"#xd21e16112" name="xd21e16112src">288</a></p>
<p class="par">After the outbreak of ferocity (<i lang="ms">ganas</i>)
among the crocodiles in the Klang River last year, some account of the
way in which the crocodile is here said to capture and destroy his
human victims may prove of interest.</p>
<p class="par">Every crocodile has, according to the Selangor Malay,
three sets of fangs, which are named as follows: (1) <i lang="ms">si
hampa daya</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e16124src" href="#xd21e16124"
name="xd21e16124src">289</a> (two above and two below), at the tip of
the jaws; (2) <i lang="ms">&#277;ntah-&#277;ntah</i> (two in the upper
and two in the lower jaw), half-way up; (3) <i lang="ms">charik
kapan</i> (two in the upper and two in the lower jaw), near the socket
of the jaws.</p>
<p class="par">The first may be translated by &ldquo;Exhaust your
devices&rdquo;; the second by &ldquo;Yes or no&rdquo;; and the third by
&ldquo;Tear the shroud,&rdquo; the latter being a reference to the
selvage which, among the Malays, is torn off the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>shroud and afterwards used for tying it up when
the corpse has been wrapped in it.</p>
<p class="par">If a man is caught by the &ldquo;Exhausters of all
Resources,&rdquo; he has a fair chance of escape; if caught by the
&ldquo;Debateable&rdquo; teeth his escape is decidedly problematical;
but if caught by the &ldquo;Tearers of the Shroud,&rdquo; he is to all
intents and purposes a dead man. Whenever it effects a capture the
crocodile carries its victim at once below the surface, and either
tries to smother him in the soft, thick mud of the mangrove swamp, or
pushes him under a snag or projecting root, with the object of letting
him drown, while it retires to watch him from a short distance. After
what it considers a sufficient interval to effect its purpose, the
crocodile seizes the body of the drowned man and rises to the surface,
when it &ldquo;calls upon the Sun, Moon, and Stars to bear
witness&rdquo; that it was not guilty of the homicide&mdash;</p>
<div lang="ms" class="lgouter xd21e2709">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Bukan aku m&#277;mbunoh angkau,</p>
<p class="line">Ayer yang m&#277;mbunoh angkau.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Which, being translated, means&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;It was not I who killed you,</p>
<p class="line">It was water which killed you.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e16173src" href="#xd21e16173" name="xd21e16173src">290</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">After thrice repeating this strange performance,
the crocodile again dives and proceeds to prepare the corpse for its
prospective banquet. Embracing the corpse with its &ldquo;arms,&rdquo;
and curving the tip of its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href=
"#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>powerful tail under its own belly
(until the tail is nearly bent double), it contrives to break the
backbone of the victim, and then picking up the body once more with its
teeth, dashes it violently against a trunk or root in order to break
the long bones of the limbs. When the bones are thus so broken as to
offer no obstruction, it swallows the body whole&mdash;thus affording a
remarkable parallel to the boa in its method of devouring its prey, and
recalling Darwinian ideas of their cousin-hood. Miraculous escapes
have, however, occasionally occurred. Thus Lebai &#703;Ali was caught
by a crocodile at Batu Burok (Kuala Selangor), one evening as the tide
was ebbing, and the crocodile, after smothering him effectually (as it
thought) in the thick mud, retired to await the end. Insensibly,
however, it floated farther and farther off with the falling tide, and
Lebai &#703;Ali, seeing his opportunity, made a bold and successful
dash for freedom.</p>
<p class="par">A similar case was that of Si Ka&rsquo;, who was pushed
under a bamboo root on the river bank by the crocodile which caught
him, and who, after waiting till his formidable enemy had floated a
little farther off than usual, drew himself up by an overhanging stem
and swarmed up it. At the same moment the crocodile made a rush, and
actually caught him by the great toe, which latter, however, he
willingly surrendered to his enemy as the price of his liberty.</p>
<p class="par">A yet more marvellous escape, was that of the youth
belonging to the Government launch at Klang, who escaped, it is
related, by the time-honoured expedient of putting his thumbs into the
crocodile&rsquo;s eyes. In connection with this latter exploit, by the
way, Malay authorities assert that the crocodile&rsquo;s eyes protrude
from their sockets on stalks (like those <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>of a crab) so long as
he stays under water, the stalks being &ldquo;as long as the
forefinger,&rdquo; so that it is quite an easy matter to catch hold of
these living &ldquo;pegs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For the rest, crocodiles are said by the Malays to have
a sort of false stomach divided into several pouches or sacs, one sac
being for the stones which they swallow, and another for the clothes
and accoutrements of their human victims, these pouches being in
addition to their real stomach (in which the remains of monkeys, wild
pig, mouse-deer, and other small animals are found), and, in the case
of female specimens, the ovary. The second pair of eyes in the neck
which, Mr. Wray says, they are supposed to use when below the surface,
are in Selangor supposed to be used at night, whence they are called
<i lang="ms">mata malam</i>, or night-eyes, as opposed to their real
eyes which they are supposed to use only by day.</p>
<p class="par">As regards the stones, which crocodiles undoubtedly
swallow, they are sometimes supposed to enable each male crocodile to
keep an account of the number of rivers which it has entered, of the
number of bights it has lived in, or even of the number of its human
victims. The noise which crocodiles make when fighting resembles a loud
roar or bellow, and the Malays apply the same word <i lang=
"ms">m&#277;nguak</i> to the bellow of the crocodile as well as to that
of the buffalo.</p>
<p class="par">The wrath of the crocodile-folk is provoked by those who
wish to shoot them, in various ways, of which, perhaps, the commonest
is to dabble a <i lang="ms">sarong</i>, or (as is said to be more
effectual) a woman&rsquo;s mosquito-curtain, in the water of the river
where they live. So also to keep two sets of weights and measures (one
for buying and another for selling, as is sometimes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>done
by the Chinese), is said to be a certain means of provoking their
indignation.</p>
<p class="par">The crocodile-wizard is sometimes credited with the
power of calling the crocodile-folk together, and of discovering a
man-eater among them, and an eye-witness lately described to me the
scene on one such occasion. A Malay had been carried off and devoured
by a crocodile at Larut, and a Batu Bara man, who went by the sobriquet
of Nakhoda Hassan, undertook to discover the culprit. Sprinkling some
of the usual sacrificial rice-paste (<i lang="ms">t&#277;pong
tawar</i>) and &ldquo;saffron&rdquo; rice upon the surface of the
river, he called out in loud tones to the various tribes of crocodiles
in the river, and summoned them to appear on the surface. My informant
declares that not less than eight or ten crocodiles actually appeared,
whereupon the Pawang commanded them all to return to the bottom with
the exception of the one which was guilty. In a few moments only one
crocodile remained on the surface, and this one, on being forthwith
killed and cut open, was found to contain the garments of the
unfortunate man who had been captured by it. Similar stories of the
prowess of crocodile charmers are told by the Javanese.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16213src" href="#xd21e16213" name=
"xd21e16213src">291</a></p>
<p class="par">I shall now proceed to describe the methods and
ceremonies used for the catching of crocodiles. The following is a
description by Mr. J. H. M. Robson, of Selangor, of the most usual
method, at all events in Selangor, but it would appear from remarks
upon the subject in Dr. Denys&rsquo; work, that live as well as dead
bait is commonly used:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A small piece of hard wood, about 6 in. or 8 in.
long, and about three-quarters of an inch thick, is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>sharpened at both ends, and to the middle of
this the end of a yard of twine is firmly fastened, the twine having
about a dozen strands just held together by say a couple of knots, so
as to prevent the crocodile from biting it through, as the strands
simply get between his teeth; to the other end of this twine is
fastened a single uncut rattan, at least 20 feet long, which can be
only a quarter of an inch in diameter, but may with advantage be a
little bigger; a small stick affixed to the end of the line, to act as
a visible float, completes this part of the gear. Probably a crocodile
will eat anything, but he is certainly partial to chicken&mdash;at
least that bait is always successful in the Sepang river&mdash;so,
having killed some sort of fowl, the body is cut right through the
breast lengthways from head to tail, and the small piece of pointed
hard wood inserted, and the bird bound up again with string. Next, two
pieces of light wood are nailed together, forming a small floating
platform about a foot square, and on this the fowl is placed, raised on
miniature trestles. The small platform thus furnished is placed in a
likely spot near the bank, and the rattan line is hitched over a small
branch or a stake, so that the bait platform may not be carried away by
the tide. By the next morning the rattan line, bait and platform may
all have disappeared, which probably means that the crocodile, having
swallowed the fowl, has gone off with the rattan in tow, a tug being
sufficient to set it free, whilst the platform, thus released, has
drifted away. A crocodile will try the aggressive sometimes, so, when
going in pursuit, it is better to have a boat than a <i lang=
"ms">sampan</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16229src" href=
"#xd21e16229" name="xd21e16229src">292</a> but Malay paddles are the
most convenient in either case. It is also advisable to have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>a second man with a rifle. The crocodile has
probably a favourite place up-stream, so the boatmen paddle up on the
look-out for the rattan (which always floats), finding it at length
close to the mangrove roots bordering on the river, perhaps. The
boat-hook picks up the floating-stick end of the line, and, with a
couple of boatmen on to this and a crocodile at the other end, with the
small pointed hard wood stick across his throat, the excitement begins.
The crocodile plunges about amidst the mangrove roots under the water,
and then makes a rush; the rattan is paid out again and the boat
follows; then he rushes under the boat, perhaps at the boat, whilst the
line is steadily pulled in. This sort of thing may last some time, but
the only thing to be afraid of is the rattan&rsquo;s getting twisted
round a <i lang="ms">bakau</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e16236src"
href="#xd21e16236" name="xd21e16236src">293</a> root under water, which
might prevent a capture; otherwise, after a good deal of playing of a
rather violent nature, the continual pulling of the rattan-holders in
the boat, or his own aggressiveness, induces him to show his head above
the surface, whereat the rifles crack, and the crocodile dies, though
often not till four or five bullets have been put into different parts
of his body.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16243src" href=
"#xd21e16243" name="xd21e16243src">294</a></p>
<p class="par">I will now proceed to describe the religious ceremonies
which accompany this performance.</p>
<p class="par">The following outline of the ceremonies used in catching
a crocodile who is known to be a <i>man-eater</i>, was taken down by me
from the mouth of a noted crocodile-wizard on the Langat river. First,
you take strips of bark of a river-side bush or tree called <i lang=
"ms">baru-baru</i> (which must be cut down at a single stroke), and
fasten them together at each end only, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>so that they form a
rope with divided (unravelled) strands. This will form that part of
your tackle which corresponds to the gut (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;rambut</i>) of a fishing line, (<i>i.e.</i> the part just
above the hook), and the advantage of it is that the loose strands get
between the crocodile&rsquo;s teeth, and prevent it from being bitten
through as a rope would certainly be.</p>
<p class="par">Next, you take a piece of the bottommost rung of a
house-ladder (<i lang="ms">anak tangga bongsu</i>), and sharpen it to a
point at both ends, so as to form a cross-piece (<i lang=
"ms">palang</i>) such as will be likely to stick in the
crocodile&rsquo;s throat. Having fastened one end of the
&ldquo;gut&rdquo; round the middle of the cross-piece, and the other to
your rattan line, the length of which may be from ten to fifteen
fathoms or so, according to the depth of the river at the spot where
the crocodile is supposed to lie, you must next cut down a young tree
to serve as the pole (<i lang="ms">chanchang</i>) to which the floating
platform and bait may be subsequently attached. This pole may be of any
kind of wood except bamboo; so when you have found a suitable tree,
take hold of it with the left hand and chop at it thrice with the
right, saying a charm as you do so&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Peace be with you, O Prophet T&#277;tap, in
whose charge is the earth,</p>
<p class="line">Peace be with you, O Prophet Noah, Planter of
Trees,</p>
<p class="line">I petition for this tree to serve as a mooring-post for
my crocodile-trap;</p>
<p class="line">If it is to kill him (the crocodile), do you fall
supine,</p>
<p class="line">If it is not to kill him, do you fall
prone.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16288src" href="#xd21e16288"
name="xd21e16288src">295</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">These last two lines refer to the omens which are
taken from the way the tree falls; the &ldquo;supine&rdquo; position
being that of a crocodile which has &ldquo;turned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>turtle,&rdquo; whereas the prone position would
be its natural attitude as it swims.</p>
<p class="par">Then start making the floating platform or raft
(<i lang="ms">rakit</i>) by chopping a plantain stem (any kind will do)
into three lengths (<i lang="ms">di-k&rsquo;ratkan tiga</i>), and then
skewering these lengths together at their ends so as to form a
triangle.</p>
<p class="par">Into the apex of this triangle firmly plant the lower
end of a strong and springy rod, making the upper end curve over
slightly in a forward direction (<i lang="ms">di-pasang-nya kayu

will be the second day when he does so; if the third time, it will be
the third day. But every time you strike the water you must say to
yourself, &ldquo;From Fatimah was your origin&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">Mani

After striking the water you may go home and rest; but you must get up
again in any case at about two in the afternoon (<i lang=

(because such a bough would resemble the bent rod of the floating
platform), and <i>never</i> (for the time being) to eat your curry
without starting by swallowing three lumps of rice successively. If you
do this it will help the bait to slide more easily down the
crocodile&rsquo;s throat, and in the same way you must <i>never</i>,
until the brute is safely landed, take any bones out of the meat in
your curry&mdash;if you do, the wooden cross-piece is sure to get loose

take the bones out of your meat before you begin, otherwise you may at

all your labour.</p>
<p class="par">I will pass on to the final capture. The crocodile has
taken the bait, we will say, and with the last of the ebb, not
unfrequently in a perilously rickety boat, you go out to look for the
tell-tale end of the line that floats up among the forked roots of the
mangrove trees. First you must go to the place where you left the
floating platform; take hold of the pole to which it is moored and

&ldquo;reptilia&rdquo; that which deals with Snakes is the most
important.</p>

that if a python is killed and this organ is cut out and kept, it will
develop into a serpent of just twice the size of that from which it was
taken. The natives positively assert that the python attains a length
of sixty to seventy feet, and that it has been known to have killed and
eaten a rhinoceros.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One of the pit vipers is exceedingly sluggish in
its movements, and will remain in the same place for days together. One

of that time it was caught and preserved. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">In Selangor, as in Perak, the &ldquo;live
gall-bladder&rdquo; of the python will (it is believed), if kept in a
jar, develop into a serpent; when dried it is in great request as a
remedy for small-pox. The story that Mr. Wray tells of the pit viper
(<i lang="ms">ular kapak daun</i>) is in Selangor told of a snake
called <i lang="ms">chintamani</i>. Selangor Malays say that it was
once upon a time a Raja of the country, and that the birds which bring
it food were then its subjects. A Malay told me that he once saw this
operation, and that the birds fed it with insects. It is reputed to be
a perfectly harmless snake, and it is considered extremely lucky to
keep one of the species in one&rsquo;s house, or even to see it. It is

<p class="par">This <i lang="ms">batu ular</i> is a prize for the
possession of which snakes are not unfrequently believed to fight, and
appears to correspond to the pearl for which in Chinese legendary lore
the dragons of that country were believed to engage in mortal combat. A
Malay remarked to me that it was always worth while if one came upon
two snakes thus engaged to kill them both, as one of them was sure to
possess this much-coveted stone, which is said to confer an almost
certain victory upon its possessor.</p>
<p class="par">Another species of &ldquo;snake-stone,&rdquo; which is
said to be manufactured by <i>Pawangs</i> from gold, silver, amalgam
(of silver and gold), tin, iron, and quicksilver, is called <i lang=

snake-bite. It is believed that this stone will adhere to the wound,
and will not fall off until it has sucked out all the poison. One of
these stones, which was sold to me in Selangor for a dollar, was about
an inch long and oval in shape; it was evidently made of some mixture
of metals, and was perforated so as to enable it to be carried on a
string.</p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="ms">ular gantang</i> is said to be a snake,
though from the description given it would seem more likely to be some
species of slow-worm or blind-worm. It is only a &ldquo;few
inches&rdquo; long, and is &ldquo;black,&rdquo; and there is said to be
little if any difference between its head and its tail. It is
considered to be extremely lucky, and when a Malay meets it, he spreads
out his head-cloth or turban on the ground, and allows it to enter,
when he carries it home and keeps it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

shadow of a grazing animal these creatures are to be discovered, and if

been drawn in a mysterious way from the veins of the animal through its
shadow. Where these noxious snails abound, the cattle become emaciated
and sometimes even die from the constant loss of blood. In the folklore
of other countries many parallels to this occur, but they differ in
either the birds, bats, or vampires, who are supposed to prey on the
life-blood of their fellows, going direct to the animals to suck the

last desperate effort to repay the burden of debt which threatened to
crush him. One day, therefore, having tried his luck for the last time,
and still caught nothing, he requested his comrades to collect an
immense quantity of mangrove leaves in their boat. Having carried these
leaves out to the fishing-ground, he scattered <span class=

on the surface of the water, together with a few handfuls of parched
and saffron-stained rice, repeating a series of most powerful spells as
he did so. The next time they fished, the leaves had turned into fish
of all shapes and sizes, and an immense haul of fish was the result.
The wizard then gave directions for the payment in full of all his
debts and the division of the balance among his children, and then
without further warning plunged into the sea only to reappear as a
porpoise.</p>

<p class="par">I will now proceed to describe the ceremony which is
supposed to secure an abundant catch of fish in the stakes.</p>
<p class="par">In January 1897 I witnessed the ceremony of sacrificing
at the fishing-stakes (<i lang="ms">m&#277;nyemah b&rsquo;lat</i>)
which took place at the hamlet of Ayer Hitam (lit.
&ldquo;Blackwater&rdquo;), in the coast district of Kuala Langat
(Selangor). The chief performer of the rites was an old Malay named
Bilal Umat, who had owned one of the fishing-stakes in the
neighbourhood for many years past, and had annually officiated at the
ceremony which I was about to witness. I and my small party arrived in
the course of the morning, and were received by Bilal Umat, who
conducted us to the long, low palm-thatch building (<i lang=
"ms">bangsal kelong</i>), just above high-water mark, in which he and
his men resided during the fishing-season. Here we found that a feast
was in course of preparation, but what most attracted my attention was
the sight of three large sacrificial basket-work trays,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16964src" href="#xd21e16964" name=
"xd21e16964src">316</a> each about 2&frac12; feet square, and with high
fringed sides which were suspended in a row from the roof of the
verandah, on the seaward side of the building. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>These trays were empty, but had been lined with
banana leaves to prepare them for the reception of the offerings, which
latter were displayed upon a raised platform standing just in front of
them.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e16975width" id="fig1"><img src=

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Ceremony of
sacrificing at the fishing-stakes.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Shortly after our arrival the loading of the trays
commenced. First Bilal Umat took a large bowl of parched rice, and
poured it into the trays, until the bottom of each tray was filled with
a layer of parched rice about an inch in depth.</p>
<p class="par">Next he took a bowl of saffron-stained rice, and
deposited about five portions of it in the centre and four corners of
each tray; then he made a similar distribution of small portions of
washed rice, of sweet potatoes (<i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ledek</i>), of
yams (<i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ladi</i>), of tapioca (<i lang="ms">ubi
kayu</i>), of bananas (<i lang="ms">pisang</i>), and betel-leaf
(<i lang="ms">sirih</i>)&mdash;there being two sets, one cooked and one
uncooked, of each of these portions, except the last. Finally, he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>added one cigarette to each portion, the
cigarette being intended for the spirits to smoke after their meal!</p>
<p class="par">A fine black goat, &ldquo;without blemish and without
spot,&rdquo; had been killed by Bilal Umat early that morning, and he
now deposited its head in the middle of the central tray, two of the
feet in the middle of the right-hand tray, and the other two feet in
the middle of that on the left. To each of these three central portions
were now added small portions of the animal&rsquo;s viscera (liver,
spleen, lights, tripe, heart, etc.), and then the small diamond-shaped
(<i lang="ms">k&#277;tupat</i>) and cylindrical (<i lang=
"ms">l&#277;pat</i>) rice-bags<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17011src"
href="#xd21e17011" name="xd21e17011src">317</a> were suspended in the
usual manner. A wax taper was added to each portion of each tray, and
the loading of the trays declared complete.</p>
<p class="par">Everything being now ready, Bilal Umat carried a smoking
censer thrice round the row of trays (walking always towards the left),
and then lighting the five wax tapers of the left-hand tray, directed
two of his men to take down this tray and sling it on a pole between
them. This they did, and we set off in procession along the sandy
foreshore at the back of the building until we came to a halt at a spot
about fifty yards off, where Bilal Umat suspended the tray from the
branch of a mangrove-tree about five feet from the ground. This done,
he faced round towards the land, and breaking off a branch of the tree,
gave utterance to three stentorian cooees, which he afterwards informed
me were intended to notify the Land Spirits (<i lang="ms">Orang
darat</i>, lit. &ldquo;Land Folk&rdquo;) of the fact that offerings
were awaiting their acceptance. Returning to the house, he manufactured
one of the leaf-brushes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17025src" href=
"#xd21e17025" name="xd21e17025src">318</a> which the Malays always used
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>for the &ldquo;Neutralising Rice-paste&rdquo;
(<i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>) rite, and we then started in a
couple of boats for the fishing-stakes, taking with us the two
remaining trays.</p>
<p class="par">Of these two trays, one was suspended by Bilal Umat from
a high wooden tripod which had been erected for the purpose, the site
selected being the centre of a shoal about half-way between the
fishing-stakes and the house. The third tray, which contained the head
of the goat (<i lang="ms">kapala kambing d&#277;ngan buah-nya</i>), was
then taken on to the fishing-stakes, Bilal Umat disposing of a large
quantity of miscellaneous offerings which he had brought with him in a
basket by strewing them upon the surface of the sea as we went
along.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17089src" href="#xd21e17089" name=
"xd21e17089src">319</a></p>
<p class="par">On reaching the stakes, the Pawang (Bilal Umat)
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>suspended the tray from a projecting pole at the
seaward end of the fishing-stakes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17209src"
href="#xd21e17209" name="xd21e17209src">320</a> and then seating
himself upon one of the timbers almost directly underneath it,
scattered handfuls of saffron-stained rice, &ldquo;washed&rdquo; rice,
and native cigarettes upon the water, just outside the two seaward
posts at the end of the stakes, and emptied out the remainder of the
parched rice upon the water just inside the &ldquo;head&rdquo; of the
stakes. Then he recited a charm, stirred the bowl of neutralising
rice-paste (<i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>) with the brush of
leaves, and taking the latter out of the bowl, sprinkled, or rather
daubed it first upon the two &ldquo;tide-braces&rdquo; of the stakes
(first upon the left &ldquo;tide-brace,&rdquo; and then upon the
right), then upon the heads of the two upright posts next to the
tide-braces, and then delegated the brush to two assistants. One of
these sprinkled the heads of all the (remaining) upright posts in the
seaward compartment of the stakes, while the other boarded the big boat
belonging to the stakes, and sprinkled the boat and all its gear from
stem to stern (commencing on the left side of the bows, and working
right down to the stern, and then recommencing on the right and working
down to the stern again). Finally, the same assistant returning to the
stakes, washed the rice-bowl in the sea just beneath the place where
Bilal Umat was sitting, and fastened up the leaf-brush to the left-hand
head-post (<i lang="ms">kayu puchi kiri</i>) at the seaward end of the
stakes. To the above account I may add that a number of taboos are
still pretty rigorously enforced by the fishing-wizards (Pawang
B&rsquo;lat) upon the coast of Selangor. I was never allowed to take
either an umbrella or boots into the fishing-stakes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>when
I visited them&mdash;the spirits having, I was told, the strongest
possible objection to the use of either.</p>
<p class="par">Other &ldquo;perpetual taboos&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">pantang salama-lama-nya</i>) are to bathe without wearing a
bathing-cloth (<i lang="ms">mandi t&#277;lanjang</i>), to throw the wet
bathing-cloth over the shoulder when returning to the house, and to rub
one foot against the other (<i lang="ms">gosok satu kaki d&#277;ngan
lain</i>). <i>Sarongs</i>, umbrellas, and shoes must never on any
pretence be worn. I may add that the first pole planted is called
<i lang="ms">Turus Tuah</i> (<i lang="ms">tua?</i>), and if the
response of the spirits to the invocation be favourable, it is believed
that it will enter the ground readily, as if pulled from below. The
only seven-days&rsquo; taboo which I have heard mentioned (though, no
doubt, there are many others) is the scrupulous observance of
chastity.</p>
<p class="par">A boat which possesses a knot in the centre of its keel,
or to which the smell of fish long adheres (<i lang="ms">p&rsquo;rahu
p&#277;ranyir</i>, or <i lang="ms">p&#277;rhanyir</i>), is supposed to
bring good luck to the fishermen.</p>
<p class="par">There is also a regular &ldquo;taboo language&rdquo;
used by the fishermen, of which the following are examples:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Fish = <i lang="ms">daun kayu</i> (tree-leaves) or <i lang=
"ms">sampah laut</i> (jetsam).</li>
<li>Snake = <i lang="ms">akar hidup</i> (living creeper).</li>
<li>Crocodile = <i lang="ms">batang kayu</i> (tree-log).</li>
<li>Seaward compartment of the stakes (<i lang="ms">bunohan</i>) =
<i lang="ms">kurong</i>.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Procuring fire by friction is an
accomplishment as common to the Malay as to the North American Indian.
The process is, however, slightly different. While the latter resorts
to circular friction, the Malay cuts a notch on the converse surface of
a bamboo, <i>across</i> which he rapidly rubs another piece cut to a
sharp edge. A fine powder is rubbed away and this ignites. Bamboo is
also used as a flint with tinder. The all-pervading match, however, is
alone used in all districts under foreign influence.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17449src" href="#xd21e17449" name=
"xd21e17449src">324</a></p>
<p class="par">The foregoing description requires to be supplemented,
for the method of procuring fire by circular friction is hardly (if at
all) less common among the Malays than the method of cross friction.
The former process takes the form of the well-known
&ldquo;fire-drill,&rdquo; both the block and the upright stick being
generally made of <i lang="ms">mahang</i> wood. The upright stick is
frequently worked by a species of &ldquo;bow,&rdquo; such as that used
by carpenters, and is kept from jumping out of the socket in which it
revolves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>by means of a cocoa-nut shell, which is pressed
down from above. When cross friction is used, a long narrow slit is
usually cut, following the grain, in the convex surface of the piece of
bamboo, the dust which is rubbed away falling through it and gradually
forming a little pile which presently ignites. It is hardly necessary
to cut a notch for the cross-piece, as a groove is very quickly worn
when the friction is started. A species of fire-syringe has also, I
believe, been collected by Mr. L. Wray in Perak.</p>

is the name of a small bird, which is said to have very gay plumage of
five colours and to resemble the green pigeon (<i lang="ms">punei</i>)
in shape, and the explanation of this charm is said to be that in the
days of King Solomon, when both the mouse-deer and his mother-in-law
wore their human forms, the Mouse-deer was greatly annoyed by the
conduct of his mother-in-law, who kept dancing in front of him as he
went. A quarrel ensued,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17492src" href=

hopping in front of it as it goes along.</p>
<p class="par">There are still some traces of the influence of
animistic ideas in that part of Malay folklore which is concerned with
fire. If an inflammable object, such as wood, falls by accident into
the fire, a stick must be used in extracting it, and the stick left, as
a substitute, in its place.</p>
<p class="par">The hearth-fire (<i lang="ms">api dapor</i>) must never
be stepped over (<i lang="ms">di-langkah-nya</i>), nor must the

does so will be &ldquo;cursed by the Rice.&rdquo;</p>

but flies by day. It can be distinguished by its short rapid note,
which resembles <i lang="ms">tegok-tegok-tegok-tegok</i>.&rdquo;
Apparently Sir W. E. Maxwell identifies this bird with the Malay
night-jar (<i lang="la">Caprimulgus macrurus.</i> Horsf.) described by
Capt. Kelham, in No. 9, page 122 of the <i>J.R.A.S.</i>, <i>S.B.</i>

to fly feet upwards (which peculiarity it shares, according to Mr.
Clifford, with the <i lang="ms">Berek-berek</i>, <i>Pub. J.R.A.S.</i>,

appears that in Europe, at all events, the legend of the Wild Huntsman
and his dogs (or Gabriel&rsquo;s Hounds, as they are often called) is
explained by the cries of wild geese flying overhead on dark nights, it
seems most convenient to give the Malay legend in connection with the
birds with which the Malays associate him. The explanation to which I
refer is to be found in Prof. Newton&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of Birds</i>
(1893), <i>sub voce</i> &ldquo;Gabble-ratchet.&rdquo; I quote <i>in
extenso</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;In many parts of England, but especially
in Yorkshire, the cries of some kind of wild goose,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7138src" href="#xd21e7138" name="xd21e7138src">17</a> when
flying by night, are heard with dismay by those who do not know the
cause of them, and are attributed to &lsquo;Gabriel&rsquo;s
Hounds,&rsquo; an expression equivalent to
&lsquo;Gabble-ratchet,&rsquo; a term often used for them, as in this
sense <i>gabble</i> is said to be a corruption of <i>Gabriel</i>, and
that, according to some medi&aelig;val glossaries, is connected with
<i lang="ms">gabbara</i> or <i lang="ms">gabares</i>, a word meaning a
corpse (cp. Way, <i lang="la">Promptorium Parvulorum</i>, p. 320,
<i>sub voce</i> &lsquo;Lyche&rsquo;); while <i>ratchet</i> is
undoubtedly the same as the Anglo-Saxon <i>r&aelig;ce</i> and Middle
English <i>racche</i> or <i>rache</i>, a dog that hunts by scent and
gives tongue. Hence the expression would originally mean
&lsquo;corpse-hounds,&rsquo; and possibly has to do with legends such
as that of the Wild Huntsman.... The sounds are at times very
marvellous, not to say impressive, when heard, as they almost
invariably are, on a pitch-dark night, and it has more than once
happened within the writer&rsquo;s knowledge that a flock of geese,
giving utterance to them, has continued for some hours to circle over a
town or village in such a way as to attract the attention of the most
unobservant of its inhabitants, and inspire with terror those among
them who are prone to superstition. (Cp. Atkinson, <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, ser. 4, vii. pp. 439, 440, and <i>Cleveland Glossary</i>,

Robinson, <i>Glossary Whitby</i>, (Engl. Dial. Soc.) p. 74; and Addy,
<i>Glossary Sheffield</i> (Engl. Dial. Soc.) p. 83. Mr. Charles
Swainson (<i>Prov. Names</i>, <i>Br. B.</i>, p. 98), gives
&lsquo;Gabble-ratchet&rsquo; as a name of the <i>night-jar</i>, but

alternative method was thus described to me by a magician: Take a white
cup, fill it with water, fumigate it with incense, and deposit it in
the hole dug to receive the centre-post. Early next morning take note
of it; if it is still full of water, it is a good sign; if the water
has wasted (<i lang="ms">susut</i>), a bad one. If live insects are
found in it, it is a good sign, if dead ones, bad. There can, however,
be little doubt that the original victim of this sacrifice was a human
victim (generally perhaps a slave), for whom the buffalo was
substituted (the goat, fowl, and egg representing further successive
stages in the depreciation of the rite). Malays on the Selangor coast
more than once told me they had heard that the Government was in the
habit of burying a human head under the foundations of any unusually
large structure (<i>e.g.</i> a bridge), and two cases where a local

was waged between them in a bygone age. The Siamangs defeated their

This instrument consisted of a single short joint of bamboo, about nine

near which was an orifice into which the performer blew. These

of the bark on one side or some similar cause, an excrescence like a
gigantic rat-tail will form on one side of the stem, a peculiarity
which is believed to give the stick that is made from it immense value.
To merely tap a person in play with one of these sticks (which are
called <i lang="ms">s&#277;ngat pari</i> or &ldquo;sting-rays&rsquo;
tails&rdquo;) will, it is believed, raise a most painful weal, whilst
to strike a person hard with one would assuredly kill him. A
Malacca-cane, one of whose knots is inverted and the other not, is also
considered of great value, being believed to render the bearer of it

&ldquo;Certain customs are observed in Siak in the collection of wax
which may be mentioned here.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">sialang</i> (that is, a
tree on which bees have made nests) is generally considered to belong
to him who finds it, provided it stands in a part of the forest
belonging to his tribe. Should the tree stand in a part of the jungle
apportioned to another tribe, the finder is permitted to take for once
all the wax there is on the tree, and ever afterwards, during his
lifetime, all the wax of one branch of the tree. After his death the
tree becomes the property of the tribe to whom that part of the jungle
belongs.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;When wax is collected from a tree there
are generally three persons to share in it, and the proceeds are
divided as follows: viz., one-third to the proprietor of the tree,
one-third to the man who climbs the tree, and one-third to the man who
keeps watch below. These two latter offices are considered rather
dangerous, the first because he has to climb the towering <i lang=
"ms">sialang</i> trees, branchless to a considerable height, by means
of bamboo pegs driven into the trunk; and the watch-keeper underneath,
because he has to face the bears and tigers who (so it is said) come
after the wax and honey.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The following trees are generally
inhabited by bees (<i lang="ms">lebah</i>), and then become <i lang=
"ms">sialangs</i>; near the sea, <i lang="ms">pulei</i>, <i lang=
"ms">kempas</i>, <i lang="ms">kayu arah</i>, and <i lang="ms">babi
kurus</i>; whilst farther in the interior <i lang="ms">ringas manuk</i>
and <i lang="ms">chempedak ayer</i> are their general habitats.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;Besides the <i lang="ms">lebah</i> there
is to be found in Siak another bee, called <i lang="ms">neruan</i>,
which does not make its nest on trees, but in holes.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The regulations observed when taking the
wax of the <i lang="ms">lebah</i> do not apply to the taking of the wax
and honey of the <i lang="ms">neruan</i>. Anybody is at liberty to look
for them wherever and whenever he likes.&rdquo;&mdash;F. Kehding, in

&ldquo;Camphor is a gum (not the pith or heart of wood, as Avicenna and
some others think), which, falling into the pith-chamber of the wood,
is extracted thence or exudes from the cracks. This I saw in a table of
camphor wood at a certain apothecary&rsquo;s, and in a piece of wood as
thick as the thigh, presented to me by Governor John Crasto, and again
in a tablet a span broad at a merchant&rsquo;s. I would not, however,
deny that it may sometimes be deposited in the hollow of a tree. It is
told me as a fact, that it is the custom that when any one who goes out
to collect it has filled his gourd, if any other stronger person sees
him with the gourd, he can kill him with impunity and take away the
gourd, fortune assisting him in this. That which is brought from Borneo
is usually mixed with small bits of stone, or some kind of gum called
Chamderros, much like raw sugar or sawdust. But this defect is easily
detected; I know no other method of adulteration. For if sometimes it
is seen to be spotted with red or blackish dots, that is due to
treatment with dirty or impure hands, or they may be caused by
moisture. But this defect is easily remedied by the Indians. If it is
tied up in a cloth and dipped in warm water to which soap and
lime-juice has been added, and then carefully dried in the shade, it
becomes very white, the weight not being altered. I saw this done by a
Hindu friend who entrusted me with the secret.... What they say as to
all kinds of animals flying together to its shade to escape the fiercer
beasts is fabulous. Nor is it what some, following Serapion, write less
so, namely, that it is an omen of larger yields when the sky glitters
with frequent lightning, or echoes with constant thunder. For as the
island of Sumatra, which some think to be Taprobane, and the adjacent
regions are near the equinoctial line, it follows that they are subject
to constant thunderstorms, and for the same cause have storms or slight
showers every day; so camphor ought to be abundant every year. From
which it is clear that the thunder is neither the cause nor indication
of a larger supply of camphor.&rdquo;&mdash;Garcia in the <i lang=
"la">Historia Aromatum</i> (1593), quoted in <i>J.R.A.S.</i>,
<i>S.B.</i>, No. 26, p. 37.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The camphor is so far considered as a
<i lang="ms">barang larangan</i> that nobody is allowed to go and
collect it without having a special permit from the Sultan. This permit
is only given after the Sultan has made sure that a good <i lang=
"ms">Pawang</i> accompanies the party, a man who is able to know from
the outside of a tree whether it contains camphor or not.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The gratuity to be given to the <i lang=
"ms">Pawang</i> is not fixed by law, but is settled beforehand on every
expedition; also the share of the Sultan.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The regulations which have to be
observed when collecting camphor are most strange; for instance, those
who go on the expedition are not permitted during the whole time of its
duration to wash or bathe; they have to use a peculiar language, which
differs from ordinary Malay. Compare what is known on this point of
similar usages amongst the Battaks.</p>

what may be called the &ldquo;dry&rdquo; method of planting rice
(<i lang="ms">b&#277;rhuma</i> or <i lang="ms">b&#277;rladang</i>) the
ceremonies naturally differ somewhat, as the forest has to be felled,
if not every year, at least more often than is the case with the
&ldquo;wet&rdquo; system; and the rice-seed is not sown in nurseries
(as a rule), but either scattered broadcast or planted with the dibble
whilst the ground cultivated is comparatively dry and no embankments
are required. This is not, of course, intended to be an exhaustive

(<i>v.</i> p. 2, <i>supra</i>). There were two young women of Belidung,
the one named Wan-Ampu, and the other Wan-Malin, employed in
cultivating rice on this mountain, where they had large and productive
rice-grounds. One night they beheld their rice-fields gleaming and
glittering like fire. Then said Ampu to Malin, &lsquo;What is that
light which is so brilliant? I am frightened to look at it.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Make no noise,&rsquo; said Malin, &lsquo;it is some great snake
or <i>naga</i>.&rsquo; Then they both lay quiet for fear. When it was
daylight they arose and went to see what it was shone so bright during
the night. They both ascended the hill, and found the grain of the rice
converted into gold, the leaves into silver, and the stalks into brass,
and they were extremely surprised, and said, &lsquo;This is what we
observed during the night.&rsquo;&rdquo; The account proceeds to show
how the prodigy was due to a supernatural visit from a descendant of
Raja Secander Zulkarneini.&mdash;Leyden, <i>Mal. Ann.</i>, pp. 20, 21.

During the performance of this part of the ceremony (which is called
<i lang="ms">ch&#277;rangkan tali t&rsquo;rap</i>) omens are taken as
to the prosperity or otherwise of the people of the house, and the
observations have therefore to be made with the greatest care. The most
disastrous omen is the cawing of a crow or rook; next to this (in point
of disastrous significance) comes the mewing cry of the kite, and,
thirdly, the flight of the ground-dove (<i lang="ms">t&#277;kukur</i>).
A good omen is the flight of the bird called the Rice&rsquo;s Husband
(<i lang="ms">Laki Padi</i>), but the best omen is the absence of any
portent or sound, even such as the falling of a tree, the crackling of
a branch, or a shout in the distance, all of which are harbingers of
misfortune of some sort.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

nine o&rsquo;clock (<i lang="ms">angkat k&#277;ning</i>, lit.
&lsquo;Raise the eyebrow&rsquo;), turn up the whites of your eyes,
swallow the water in your mouth, and your rice will be smooth and white
and easily swallowed. But if you want it to be a little rough (<i lang=
"ms">k&#277;sat</i>), so that you may not be tempted to eat too much of
it during hard times, instead of directly swallowing the water in your
mouth, you must put the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth,
and contract the throat thrice, slowly swallowing as you do so.&rdquo;
To the above she then added: &ldquo;Besides this, you can make the
whole field of rice break into waves by standing up, clapping the
hands, and then pushing each hand right up the sleeve of the opposite
arm (I am not quite sure if I rightly understood this last, but am
fairly certain that it is correct&mdash;my notes have only &lsquo;run

extreme voluminousness of Malay folk-lore upon the subject of
rice-planting makes it impossible to do more than give a general idea
of the ceremonies described. The ceremonies, however, are comparatively
homogeneous in all parts of the Peninsula, and the specimens given may
be taken as fairly representative. In the Appendix (xciii.
<i>seqq.</i>), will be found a number of invocations, collected by Mr.
O&rsquo;Sullivan and myself, which are addressed to the rice-spirit and
may help to emphasise or explain some of the details. One of these
invocations should certainly help to emphasise the strength of the
anthropomorphic conception of the Rice-soul as held by Malays. It runs
as follows (<i>vide</i> App. <a href="#a.cx">cx</a>.):&mdash;</p>

About 1878, the principal <i lang="ms">pawang</i> of the L&acirc;rut
district, one Pa&rsquo;Itam Dam, applied to me as Assistant-Resident to
reinstate him in the duties and privileges which he had enjoyed under
the Orang Kaya Mantri, and before him, under Che Long J&#703;affar. He
describes the customary ceremonies and dues to be as follows:&mdash;He
had to visit all the mines from time to time, especially those from
which tin-ore was being removed; if the daily output of tin suddenly
decreased on any mine it was his business at once to repeat certain
invocations (<i lang="ms">puja</i>) to induce the tin-ore to remain
(<i lang="ms">handak di-pulih balik sapaya jangan mengorang biji</i>).
Once in every two or three years it was necessary to carry out an
important ceremony (<i lang="ms">puja besar</i>) which involved the
slaying of three buffaloes and a great feast, the expense of which had
to be borne by the <i lang="ms">pawang</i>. On the day of the <i lang=
"ms">puja besar</i> strict abstinence from work is enjoined on every
one in the district, no one might break ground or even pull up weeds or
cut wood in the whole province. Further, no stranger whose home was
three days&rsquo; journey away might enter one of the mines under a
penalty of twenty-five dollars.</p>
<p class="par footnote">The <i lang="ms">pawang</i> was entitled to
exact from the owners of mines a customary payment of one slab of tin
(or $6.25 in cash) per annum for every sluice-box (<i lang=
"ms">palong</i>) in work during the year.</p>
<p class="par footnote">In any mine from which the tin-ore had not yet
been removed it was strictly forbidden to wear shoes or to carry an
umbrella; no Malay might wear a <i lang="ms">sarong</i>.</p>
<p class="par footnote">The Chinese miners, always superstitiously
disposed, used (under Malay rule) to adhere to these rules and submit
to these exactions, but since 1875 the <i lang="ms">pawang</i> has

&ldquo;The Guliga, more commonly known as Bezoar, forms a recognised
article of export from the Rejang and Bintulu rivers in the Sarawak
territory. These concretions are chiefly obtained from a red monkey (a
species of <i lang="la">Semnopithecus</i>), which seems to be very
abundant in the interior districts of Borneo. A more valuable Guliga,
called the &lsquo;Guliga Landak,&rsquo; is obtained from the porcupine,
but it is comparatively rare. The Sepoys stationed at Sibu Fort in the
Rejang formerly exported considerable numbers of these calculi to
Hindustan, where, in addition to their supposed efficacy as an antidote
for the poison of snakes and other venomous creatures, they appear to
be applied, either alone or in combination with other medicines, to the
treatment of fevers, asthmatic complaints, general debility, etc. A few
years ago, however, these men ceased to send any but the Guliga Landak,
since their <i lang="ms">hakims</i> had informed them that the
concretions obtained from the monkeys had come to be considered of very
doubtful, if any, value from a medicinal point of view. The usual test
for a good Guliga is to place a little <i lang="ms">chunam</i> on the
hand and to rub the Guliga against it, when, if it be genuine, the lime
becomes tinged with yellow. Imitations are by no means rare, and on one
occasion which came to my own knowledge, some Bakatans succeeded in
deceiving the Chinamen, who trade in these articles, by carefully
moulding some fine light clay into the form of a Bezoar, and then
rubbing it well all over with a genuine one. The extreme lightness of a
real Guliga and the lime test are, however, generally sufficient to
expose a counterfeit Bezoar. The Sepoys and Malays apply various
imaginary tests. Thus they assert that if a true Guliga be clasped in
the closed fist the bitter taste of the concretion will be plainly
susceptible to the tongue when applied to the back of the hand, and
even above the elbow if the Guliga be a good &lsquo;Landak&rsquo;; and
a Sepoy once assured me that having accidentally broken one of the
latter he immediately was sensible of a bitter taste in the mouth.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;Accounts vary very much among the
natives as to the exact position in which the Guligas are found: some
saying they may occur in any part of the body, others that they occur
only in the stomach and intestines, whilst I have heard others declare
that they have taken them from the head and even the hand! Bezoar
stones are sold by weight, the gold scale being used, and the value
varies according to quality and to the scarcity or abundance of the
commodity at the time of sale. The ordinary prices paid at Rejang a few
years ago were from $1.50 to $2 per <i lang="ms">amas</i> for common
stones and from $2.50 to $4 per <i lang="ms">amas</i> for Guliga
Landak. I have seen one of the latter which was valued at $100. It was
about the size of an average Tangiers orange, and was perfectly
spherical. The surface, where not artificially abraded, was smooth,
shining, bronze-brown, studded with numerous irregularly-shaped
fragments of dark rich brown standing out slightly above the general
mass of the calculus. These fragments, in size and appearance, bore a
close resemblance to the crystals in a coarse-grained porphyritic
rock.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The common monkey-bezoars vary much in
colour and shape. I have seen them of the size of large filberts,
curiously convoluted and cordate in shape, with a smooth, shining
surface of a pale olive-green hue. Mr. A. R. Houghton once showed me
one which was an inch and a half long, and shaped like an Indian club.
It was of a dirty greenish colour, perfectly smooth and cylindrical,
and it had become aggregated around a portion of a sumpitan dart, which
appears to have penetrated the animal&rsquo;s stomach, and being broken
off short has subsequently served as the nucleus for the formation of a
calculus. The same gentleman had in his possession two Landak stones,
one of which bore a close resemblance to a block in shape, and was of a
bright green colour, and the second was of a rich chocolate brown, and
could best be likened in form to a constable&rsquo;s staff. One
porcupine stone which was opened was found to be a mere shell full of
small brown shavings like shred tobacco.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The part of the island which produces
these stones in greatest abundance seems to be, by a coincidence of
native reports, the district about the upper waters of the
Balu&ntilde;gar (Batang Kayan). The story is that the head-waters of
this river are cut off from its lower course by an extensive tract of
hills beneath which the river disappears, a report by no means unlikely
if the country be, as is probable, limestone. The people of the
district have no communication with the lower course of the river, and
are thus without any supply of salt. In lieu of this necessity they
make use of the waters of certain springs, which must be saline mineral
springs, and which the Kayans call &lsquo;Su&ntilde;gan.&rsquo; These
springs are also frequented by troops of the red monkeys before
mentioned, and the Bezoars are most constantly found in the stomachs of
these animals through their drinking the saline water. The hunters lie
in wait about such springs, and, so runs the report, on the animals
coming down to drink they are able to guess with tolerable certainty
from external signs which of the monkeys will afford the Guliga, and
they forthwith shoot such with their sumpitans. I have this account,
curious in more ways than one, from several quite independent sources.
In concluding these brief notes, I may remark that the wide-spread idea
of the medicinal virtue of these concretions would lead us to suppose
that there is some foundation for their
reputation.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>J.R.A.S.</i>, <i>S.B.</i>, No. 4, pp.

question of the mental attributes ascribed to the crocodile is one of
great interest, as it is credited by Malays with a human origin. It is
not alleged to shed tears over his victim; but, as the above account
shows, it is far from insensible to the enormity of manslaughter. At
the same time, it is credited with strong common sense (since it is

This and the preceding lines clearly refer to the fable quoted by Sir
W. E. Maxwell. There are, however, many differences in minor details,
one version asserting that the head of the first crocodile was made
from the central shoot or cabbage of a cocoa-nut (<i lang="ms">umbi

east; another asserting that its dorsal ridge was manufactured (by Siti

called <i lang="ms">sisa Nabi</i>, or the &ldquo;Prophet&rsquo;s
leavings,&rdquo; the story being that it had originally the same amount
of flesh on both sides, but that the Prophet Muhammad, having eaten the
whole side of one of these fish (which had been cooked and served up to
him as a meal) cast the remaining side back into the sea, whereupon it
revived and commenced swimming about as if nothing had happened,
retaining, however, the shape of a flat fish to the present day.</p>
<p class="par footnote">Cp. the following note in Sale&rsquo;s
<i>Translation of the Kor&acirc;n</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;This miracle is thus related by the
commentators. Jesus having, at the request of his followers, asked it
of God, a red table immediately descended, in their sight, between two
clouds, and was set before them, whereupon he rose up, and having made
the ablution, prayed, and then took off the cloth which covered the
table, saying, <i>In the name of God, the best provider of food</i>.
What the provisions were with which this table was furnished is a
matter wherein the expositors are not agreed. One will have them to be
nine cakes of bread and nine fishes; another, bread and flesh; another,
all sorts of food, except flesh; another, all sorts of food except
bread and flesh; another, all except bread and fish; another, one fish,
which had the taste of all manner of food; and another, fruits of
paradise, but the most received tradition is that when the table was
uncovered, there appeared a fish ready dressed, without scales or
prickly fins, dropping with fat, having salt placed at its head and
vinegar at its tail, and round it all sorts of herbs, except leeks, and
five loaves of bread, on one of which there were olives, on the second
honey, on the third butter, on the fourth, cheese, and on the fifth,
dried flesh. They add that Jesus, at the request of the apostles,
showed them another miracle, by restoring the fish to life, and causing
its scales and fins to return to it, at which the standers-by being
affrighted, he caused it to become as before; that 1300 men and women,
all afflicted with bodily infirmities or poverty, ate of these
provisions and were satisfied, the fish remaining whole as it was at
first; that then the table flew up to heaven in the sight of all; and
every one who had partaken of this food were delivered from their
infirmities and misfortunes; and that it continued to descend for forty
days together at dinner-time, and stood on the ground till the sun
declined, and was then taken up into the clouds. Some of the Mohammedan
writers are of opinion that this table did not really descend, but that
it was only a parable; but most think the words of the Koran are plain
to the contrary. A further tradition is, that several men were changed
into swine for disbelieving this miracle, and attributing it to magic
art; or, as others pretend, for stealing some of the victuals from off
it. Several other fabulous circumstances are also told which are scarce
worth transcribing.&rdquo;&mdash;Sale&rsquo;s <i>Kor&acirc;n Trans.</i>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We now come to the spirits which are believed to
attack both women and children at childbirth.</p>
<p class="par">These are four in number: the Bajang, which generally
takes the form of a pole-cat (<i lang="ms">musang</i>) and disturbs the
household by mewing like a great cat; the Langsuir, which takes the
form of an owl with long claws, which sits and hoots upon the
roof-tree; the Pontianak or Mati-anak, which, as will be seen
presently, is also a night-owl, and is supposed to be a child of the
Langsuir, and the P&#277;nanggalan, which is believed to resemble a
trunkless human head with the sac of the stomach attached to it, and
which flies about seeking for an opportunity of sucking the blood of
infants.</p>
<p class="par">With the above are often associated the Polong, which is
described as a diminutive but malicious species of bottle-imp, and the
P&#277;l&#277;sit, which is the name given to a kind of grasshopper (or
cricket?), but these latter, though often associated with the regular
birth-spirits, partake also of the character of <span class=

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">I will now take these spirits in the above order. The
Bajang, as I have said, is generally described as taking the form of a
pole-cat (<i lang="ms">musang</i>), but it appears to be occasionally
confused with the P&#277;l&#277;sit. Thus a Malay magician once told me
that the Bajang took the form of a house-cricket, and that when thus
embodied it may be kept by a man, as the P&#277;l&#277;sit may be kept
by a woman. This statement, however, must not be accepted without due
reserve, and it may be taken as a certainty that the usual conception
of the Bajang&rsquo;s embodiment is a pole-cat.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e17572src" href="#xd21e17572" name="xd21e17572src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">I need hardly say that it is considered very dangerous
to children, who are sometimes provided with a sort of armlet of black
silk threads, called a &ldquo;bajang bracelet&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">g&rsquo;lang bajang</i>), which, it is supposed, will protect them
against it. On the opposite page will <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb322" href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>be seen a remarkable
drawing<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17587src" href="#xd21e17587" name=
"xd21e17587src">3</a> (of which a facsimile is here given), which
appears to represent the outline of a Bajang,
&ldquo;scripturally&rdquo; modified to serve as a counter-charm against
the Bajang itself.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17590src" href=
"#xd21e17590" name="xd21e17590src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">The following account of the Bajang is by Sir Frank
Swettenham:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Some one in the village falls ill of a complaint
the symptoms of which are unusual; there may be convulsions,
unconsciousness, or delirium, possibly for some days together or with
intervals between the attacks. The relatives will call in a native
doctor, and at her (she is usually an ancient female) suggestion, or
without it, an impression will arise that the patient is the victim of
a <i lang="ms">b&acirc;jang</i>. Such an impression quickly develops
into certainty, and any trifle will suggest the owner of the evil
spirit. One method of verifying this suspicion is to wait till the
patient is in a state of delirium, and then to question him or her as
to who is the author of the trouble. This should be done by some
independent person of authority, who is supposed to be able to
ascertain the truth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323"
name="pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A further and convincing proof is then to call in
a &lsquo;<i lang="ms">Pawang</i>&rsquo; skilled in dealing with wizards
(in Malay countries they are usually men), and if he knows his business
his power is such that he will place the sorcerer in one room, and,
while he in another scrapes an iron vessel with a razor, the
culprit&rsquo;s hair will fall off as though the razor had been applied
to his head instead of to the vessel! That is supposing he <i>is</i>
the culprit; if not, of course he will pass through the ordeal without
damage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have been assured that the shaving process is
so efficacious that, as the vessel represents the head of the person
standing his trial, wherever it is scraped the wizard&rsquo;s hair will
fall off in a corresponding spot. It might be supposed that under these
circumstances the accused is reasonably safe, but this test of guilt is
not always employed. What more commonly happens is that when several
cases of unexplained sickness have occurred in a village, with possibly
one or two deaths, the people of the place lodge a formal complaint
against the supposed author of these ills, and desire that he be
punished.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Before the advent of British influence it was the
practice to kill the wizard or witch whose guilt had been established
to Malay satisfaction, and such executions were carried out not many
years ago.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I remember a case in Perak less than ten years
ago, when the people of an up-river village accused a man of keeping a
<i lang="ms">b&acirc;jang</i>, and the present Sultan, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>who
was then the principal Malay judge in the State, told them he would
severely punish the <i lang="ms">b&acirc;jang</i> if they would produce
it. They went away hardly satisfied, and shortly after made a united
representation to the effect that if the person suspected were allowed
to remain in their midst they would kill him. Before anything could be
done they put him, his family, and effects on a raft and started them
down the river. On their arrival at Kuala Kangsar the man was given an
isolated hut to live in, but not long afterwards he disappeared.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The hereditary <i lang="ms">b&acirc;jang</i>
comes like other evils, the unsought heritage of a dissolute ancestry,
but the acquired <i lang="ms">b&acirc;jang</i> is usually obtained from
the newly-buried body of a stillborn child, which is supposed to be the
abiding-place of a familiar spirit until lured therefrom by the
solicitations of some one who, at dead of night, stands over the grave
and by potent incantations persuades the <i lang="ms">b&acirc;jang</i>
to come forth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17672src" href=
"#xd21e17672" name="xd21e17672src">5</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is all very well for the K&#277;dah ladies to
sacrifice their shadows to obtain possession of a <i lang=
"ms">p&#277;lsit</i>, leaders of society must be in the fashion at any
cost; but there are plenty of people living in Perak who have seen more
than one ancient Malay dame taken out into the river and, despite her
protestations, her tears, and entreaties, have watched her, with hands
and feet tied, put into the water and slowly pushed down out of sight
by means of a long pole with a fork at one end which fitted on her
neck. Those who have witnessed these executions have no doubt of the
justice of the punishment, and not uncommonly add that after two or
three examples had been made there would always ensue a period of rest
from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>torments of the <i lang="ms">b&acirc;jang</i>. I
have also been assured that the <i lang="ms">b&acirc;jang</i>, in the
shape of a lizard, has been seen to issue from the drowning
person&rsquo;s nose. That statement no doubt is made on the authority
of those who condemned and executed the victim.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17693src" href="#xd21e17693" name=
"xd21e17693src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">The popular superstition about the Langsuir is thus
described by Sir William Maxwell:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If a woman dies in childbirth, either before
delivery or after the birth of a child, and before the forty days of
uncleanness have expired, she is popularly supposed to become a
<i lang="ms">langsuyar</i>, a flying demon of the nature of the
&lsquo;white lady&rsquo; or &lsquo;banshee.&rsquo; To prevent this a
quantity of glass beads are put in the mouth of the corpse, a
hen&rsquo;s egg is put under each arm-pit, and needles are placed in
the palms of the hands. It is believed that if this is done the dead
woman cannot become a <i lang="ms">langsuyar</i>, as she cannot open
her mouth to shriek (<i lang="ms">ngilai</i>) or wave her arms as
wings, or open and shut her hands to assist her flight.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17712src" href="#xd21e17712" name=
"xd21e17712src">7</a></p>
<p class="par">The superstitions about the Langsuir, however, do not
end here, for with regard to its origin the Selangor Malays tell the
following story:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">The original Langsuir (whose embodiment is supposed to
be a kind of night-owl) is described as being a woman of dazzling
beauty, who died from the shock of hearing that her child was
stillborn, and had taken the shape of the Pontianak.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e17733src" href="#xd21e17733" name="xd21e17733src">8</a> On
hearing this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>terrible news, she &ldquo;clapped her
hands,&rdquo; and without further warning &ldquo;flew whinnying away to
a tree, upon which she perched.&rdquo; She may be known by her robe of
green, by her tapering nails of extraordinary length (a mark of
beauty), and by the long jet black tresses which she allows to fall
down to her ankles&mdash;only, alas! (for the truth must be told) in
order to conceal the hole in the back of her neck through which she
sucks the blood of children! These vampire-like proclivities of hers
may, however, be successfully combated if the right means are adopted,
for if you are able to catch her, cut short her nails and luxuriant
tresses, and stuff them into the hole in her neck, she will become tame
and indistinguishable from an ordinary woman, remaining so for years.
Cases have been known, indeed, in which she has become a wife and a
mother, until she was allowed to dance at a village merry-making, when
she at once reverted to her ghostly form, and flew off into the dark
and gloomy forest from whence she came.</p>

<p class="par">In their wild state, a Malay once informed me, these
woman-vampires are exceedingly fond of fish, and once and again may be
seen &ldquo;sitting in crowds on the fishing-stakes at the river mouth
awaiting an opportunity to steal the fish.&rdquo; However that may be,
it seems curiously in keeping with the following charm for
&ldquo;laying&rdquo; a Langsuir:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O ye mosquito-fry at the river&rsquo;s mouth</p>
<p class="line">When yet a great way off, ye are sharp of eye,</p>
<p class="line">When near, ye are hard of heart.</p>
<p class="line">When the rock in the ground opens of itself</p>
<p class="line">Then (and then only) be emboldened the hearts of my

<p class="line">May your heart be softened when you behold me,</p>
<p class="line">By grace of this prayer that I use, called Silam
Bayu.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The &ldquo;mosquito-fry at the river&rsquo;s
mouth&rdquo; in the first line is no doubt intended as an allusion to
the Langsuir who frequent the fishing-stakes.</p>
<p class="par">The Pontianak (or Mati-anak), as has already been said,
is the stillborn child of the Langsuir, and its embodiment is like that
of its mother, a kind of night-owl.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e17785src" href="#xd21e17785" name="xd21e17785src">9</a> Curiously
enough, it appears to be the only one of these spirits which rises to
the dignity of being addressed as a &ldquo;Jin&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Genie,&rdquo; as appears from the charms which are used for
laying it. Thus we find in a common charm:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O Pontianak the Stillborn,</p>
<p class="line">May you be struck dead by the soil from the
grave-mound.</p>
<p class="line">Thus (we) cut the bamboo-joints, the long and the
short,</p>
<p class="line">To cook therein the liver of the Jin (Demon)
Pontianak.</p>
<p class="line">By the grace of &lsquo;There is no god but
God,&rsquo;&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">To prevent a stillborn child from becoming a
Pontianak the corpse is treated in the same way as that of the mother,
<i>i.e.</i> a hen&rsquo;s egg is put under each armpit, a needle in the
palm of each hand, and (probably) glass beads or some simple equivalent
in its mouth. The charm which is used on this occasion will be found in
the Appendix.</p>
<p class="par">The Pe&#277;nanggalan is a sort of monstrous vampire
which delights in sucking the blood of children. The story goes that
once upon a time a woman was sitting, to perform a religious penance
(<i lang="ms">dudok b&#277;rtapa</i>), in one of the large wooden vats
which are used by the Malays for holding the vinegar made by drawing
off the sap <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>of the thatch-palm (<i lang="ms">m&#277;nyadap
nipah</i>). Quite unexpectedly a man came in, and finding her sitting
in the vat, asked her, &ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; To this
the woman replied, &ldquo;What business have you to ask?&rdquo; but
being very much startled she attempted to escape, and in the excitement
of the moment, kicked her own chin with such force that the skin split
round her neck, and her head (with the sac of the stomach depending
from it) actually became separated from the trunk, and flew off to
perch upon the nearest tree. Ever since then she has existed as a
spirit of evil, sitting on the roof-tree whinnying (<i lang=
"ms">m&#277;ngilai</i>) whenever a child is born in the house, or
trying to force her way up through the floor on which the child lies,
in order to drink its blood.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17823src" href=
"#xd21e17823" name="xd21e17823src">10</a></p>
<p class="par">The only two spirits of this class which now remain are
the Polong and the P&#277;l&#277;sit, and these, as I have said,
partake to a great extent of the character <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>of
familiar spirits or bottle imps, and are by no means confined to a
single &ldquo;r&ocirc;le&rdquo; as the preceding ones have been.</p>
<p class="par">The Polong resembles an exceedingly diminutive female
figure or mannikin, being in point of size about as big as the top
joint of the little finger. It will fly through the air to wherever it
is told to go, but is always preceded by its pet or plaything (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;mainan</i>), the P&#277;l&#277;sit, which, as has already
been said, appears to be a species of house-cricket. Whenever the
Polong wishes to enter (<i lang="ms">di-rasoki</i>) a new victim, it
sends the P&#277;l&#277;sit on before it, and as soon as the latter,
&ldquo;flying in a headlong fashion (<i lang=
"ms">m&#277;n&#277;l&#277;ntang m&#277;nj&#277;rongkong</i>),&rdquo;
has entered its victim&rsquo;s body, which it usually does
<i>tail</i>-foremost, and begins to chirp, the Polong follows. It is
generally hidden away outside the house by its owner (<i lang=
"ms">Jinjangan</i>), and fed with blood pricked from the finger. The
description usually given of a Polong tallies curiously with the Malay
definition of the soul.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17899src" href=
"#xd21e17899" name="xd21e17899src">12</a></p>
<p class="par">The last of these spirits, the P&#277;l&#277;sit (or
house-cricket?), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330"
name="pb330">330</a>]</span>which is the Polong&rsquo;s
&ldquo;plaything&rdquo; or pet, flies to and fro (<i lang="ms">rasok
sini</i>, <i lang="ms">rasok sana</i>) till it finds the body which its
mistress has ordered it to enter, harm only being done when it enters
tail-foremost, as it generally does. It is occasionally caught and kept
in a bottle by Malay women, who feed it either on parched or
saffron-stained rice, or on blood drawn from the tip of the fourth
finger which they prick for the purpose, and who, when they wish to get
rid of it, bury it in the ground. When a sick person is affected by a
P&#277;l&#277;sit (one of the signs of which is to rave about
cats)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17930src" href="#xd21e17930" name=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=

up its residence in the patient&rsquo;s body, with the words:
&ldquo;Who is your mother?&rdquo; To this question the
P&#277;l&#277;sit replies, speaking with the patient&rsquo;s voice, but
in a high falsetto key, and giving the name of the person who sent it,
whereupon prompt measures are taken to compel the owner to recall it.
It now only remains to describe the means employed by the Malays to
secure one of these familiar spirits, which can be guaranteed to cause
the greatest possible annoyance to your enemy, with the least possible
trouble on your own part.</p>

&ldquo;I wish to engage you for my child&rdquo; (<i lang=

accessories of the betel-chewing ceremony being deposited in the
<i lang="ms">ch&#277;rana</i> itself. The Bidan, on receiving the
<i lang="ms">ch&#277;rana</i>, and charming the contents, inverts it,
pouring out (<i lang="ms">di-chorahkan</i>) its contents upon the
floor, and taking omens for the coming event from the manner in which
they fall.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18068src" href="#xd21e18068"

some species of divination (<i lang="ms">tengo&rsquo; dalam

horoscope. This object may be achieved in several ways; <i>e.g.</i> by
astrological calculations; by casting up (<i lang="ms">palak</i> or

<p class="par">When the time arrives the Bidan is sent for and escorted
to the spot, where she points out the luckiest place in the house for
the child to be born. Such a spot must not be under the ends of the
slats of the palm-thatch, but between them, the exact spot being
discovered by repeatedly dropping the blade of a hatchet or cutlass
haft downwards into the ground below the raised floor of the house,
until a spot is found wherein it sticks and remains upright. A rattan
loop (<i lang="ms">tali anggas</i>) to enable the patient to raise
herself to a sitting posture, is suspended from the rafters over
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=

just exactly beneath it under the floor of the house (which is raised

name="xd21e18125src">21</a> and a <i lang="ms">l&#277;kar jantan</i>,
which is a kind of rattan stand used for Malay cooking-pots. The leaves
of these plants are used because it is thought that their thorns will
prick any evil spirit<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18133src" href=
"#xd21e18133" name="xd21e18133src">22</a> which tries to get at the
child from below, whilst the circular cooking-pot stand will act as a
noose or snare. Over the patient&rsquo;s head, and just under the
rafters, is spread a casting-net (<i lang="ms">jala</i>), together with
a bunch of leaves of the red drac&aelig;na (<i lang=

<p class="par">A big tray (<i lang="ms">talam</i>) is now filled with a
measure of uncooked husked rice (<i lang="ms">b&rsquo;ras
sa-gantang</i>), and covered over with a small mat of screw-palm leaves
(<i lang="ms">tikar m&#277;ngkuang</i>). This mat is in turn covered
with from three to seven thicknesses of fine Malay <i>sarongs</i> (a
sort of broad plaid worn as a skirt), and these latter again are
surmounted by a second mat upon which the newly-born infant is to be
deposited.</p>
<p class="par">The next process is the purification of mother and child
by a ceremony which consists of bathing both in warm water just not hot
enough to scald the skin (<i lang="ms">ayer p&#277;sam-p&#277;sam
jangan m&#277;lochak kulit</i>), and in which are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=

the dried leaves (<i lang="ms">k&#277;ronsong</i> or <i lang=
"ms">k&#277;resek</i>) of the <i lang="ms">pisang k&rsquo;lat</i>. This
has to be repeated (every?) morning and evening. In most places the
new-born infant is, as has been said, laid upon a mat and formally
adopted by the father, who breathes into the child&rsquo;s ear<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18203src" href="#xd21e18203" name=
"xd21e18203src">24</a> a sort of Muhammadan prayer or formula, which is
called <i lang="ms">bang</i> in the case of a boy, and <i lang=
"ms">kamat</i> in the case of a girl. After purification the child is
swaddled in a sort of papoose; an inner bandage (<i lang=
"ms">barut</i>) is swathed round the child&rsquo;s waist, and a broad
cloth band (<i lang="ms">kain lampin</i>) is wound round its body from
the knees to the breast, after which the outer bandage (<i lang=
"ms">kain b&#277;dong</i>) is wound round the child&rsquo;s body from
the feet to the shoulder, and is worn continually until the child is
three or four months old, or, in Malay parlance, until he has learned
to crawl (<i lang="ms">tahu m&#277;niarap</i>). This contrivance, it is
alleged, prevents the child from starting and straining its muscles.
Over the child&rsquo;s mat is suspended a sort of small conical
mosquito-net (<i lang="ms">kain bochok</i>), the upper end of which is
generally stitched (<i lang="ms">di-s&#277;mat</i>) or pinned on to the
top of the parent&rsquo;s mosquito curtain, and which is intended to
protect the child from any stray mosquito or sandfly which may have
found its way into the bigger net used by his parents. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Next comes the ceremony of marking the forehead
(<i lang="ms">chonting muka</i>), which is supposed to keep the child
from starting and straining itself (<i lang="ms">jangan
t&#277;rk&#277;jut t&#277;rk&#277;kau</i>), and from convulsions
(<i lang="ms">sawan</i>), and at the same time to preserve it from evil
spirits. The following are the directions:&mdash;Take chips of wood
from the thin end (<i lang="ms">kapala?</i>) of the threshold, from the
steps of the house-ladder, and from the house furniture, together with
a coat (<i lang="ms">kesip</i>) of garlic, a coat of an onion,
assaf&oelig;tida, a rattan cooking-pot stand, and fibre from the
&ldquo;monkey-face&rdquo; of an unfertile cocoa-nut (<i lang=
"ms">tampo&rsquo; niyor jantan</i>). Burn all these articles together,
collect the ashes, and mix them by means of the fore-finger with a
little &ldquo;betel-water.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Now repeat the proper charm,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18300src" href="#xd21e18300" name="xd21e18300src">25</a> dip the
finger in the mixture, and mark the centre of the child&rsquo;s
forehead, if a boy with a sign resembling what is called a bench mark
<img src="images/tri-vi.png" alt="[V]" width="11" height="14">, if a
girl with a plain cross +, and at the same time put small daubs on the
nose, cheeks, chin, and shoulders. Then mark the mother with a line
drawn from breast to breast (<i lang="ms">pangkah susu</i>) and a daub
on the end of the nose (<i lang="ms">cholek hidong</i>). If you do this
properly, a Langat Malay informed me, the Evil One will take mother and
child for his own wife and child (who are supposed to be similarly
marked) and will consequently refrain from harming them!</p>
<p class="par">In addition to the above, if the child is a girl, her
eyebrows are shaved and a curve drawn in their place, extending from
the root of the nose to the ear (<i lang="ms">di-pantiskan b&#277;ntok
taji d&#277;ri muka sampei p&#277;lipis</i>). The mixture used for
marking these curves consists of <i lang="ms">manjakani</i> mixed with
milk from the mother&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p class="par">Another most curious custom which recalls a parallel
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>custom among North American Indians, is
occasionally resorted to for the purpose of altering the shape of the
child&rsquo;s head. When it is considered too long (<i lang=
"ms">t&#277;rlampau panjang</i>), a small tightly-fitting &ldquo;yam
leaf cap&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">songko&rsquo; daun k&rsquo;ladi</i>),
consisting of seven thicknesses of calladium (yam) leaves is used to
compress it. This operation is supposed to shorten the child&rsquo;s
skull, and the person who fits it on to the child&rsquo;s head uses the
words&mdash;&ldquo;Muhammad, short be your head&rdquo; in the case of a
boy, and &ldquo;Fatimah, short be your head&rdquo; in the case of a
girl.</p>
<p class="par">Now comes the ceremony of administering to the infant
what is called the &ldquo;mouth-opener&rdquo; (lit.
&ldquo;mouth-splitter,&rdquo; <i lang="ms">p&#277;mb&rsquo;lah
mulut</i>); first, you take a green cocoa-nut (<i lang="ms">niyor
sungkoran</i>), split it in halves (<i lang="ms">di-b&rsquo;lah
niyor</i>), put a &ldquo;grain&rdquo; of salt inside one-half of the
shell (<i lang="ms">di-buboh garam sa-buku</i>), and give it to the
child to drink, counting up to seven, and putting it to the
child&rsquo;s mouth at the word seven (<i lang="ms">l&#277;takkan di
mulut-nya</i>). Then repeat the ceremony, substituting <i lang=
"ms">asam</i> (tamarinds?) for the salt. Finally, take a gold ring, and
after rubbing it against the inside of the cocoa-nut (<i lang=
"ms">cholek di-dalam niyor</i>), lay it upon the child&rsquo;s lips,
(<i lang="ms">l&#277;takkan di bibir-nya</i>), saying
&ldquo;Bismillah,&rdquo; etc. Do the same with a silver and amalgam
(gold and silver) ring respectively, and the ceremony will be at an
end.</p>
<p class="par">I may note, in passing, that it is in allusion to the
above ceremony that you will sometimes hear old men say
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the first time I tasted salt, I did so ever since
I was first put into my swinging-cot&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">aku makan
garam dahulu, d&#277;ripada tatkala naik buayan</i>).</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes a little &ldquo;rock&rdquo; sugar (<i lang=
"ms">gula batu</i>) is added to make the &ldquo;mouth-opener&rdquo;
more palatable.</p>
<p class="par">From the time when the child is about twenty-four
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>hours old until it is of the age of three
months, it is fed with rice boiled in a pot on the fire,
&ldquo;broken&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">di-lechek</i>) by means of a short
broad cocoa-nut shell spoon (<i lang="ms">p&#277;lechek</i>), mixed
with a little sugar and squeezed into small receptacles of woven
cocoa-nut leaf (<i lang="ms">k&#277;tupat</i>).</p>
<p class="par">Later it is taught to feed at the breast (<i lang=
"ms">m&#277;netek</i>), which continues until it is weaned by the
application of bitter aloes (<i lang="ms">jadam</i>) to the
mother&rsquo;s breasts.</p>
<p class="par">In the rice-jar (<i lang="ms">buyong b&rsquo;ras</i>)
during this period, a stone, a big iron nail, and a
&ldquo;candle-nut&rdquo; must be kept, and a spoon (<i lang=
"ms">s&#277;ndok</i>) must always be used for putting the rice into the
pot before boiling it. Moreover, the mother, when eating or drinking,
must always cross her left arm under her breasts (<i lang="ms">di-ampu
susu-nya di l&#277;ngan kiri</i>) leaving the right arm free to bring
the food to the mouth.</p>
<p class="par">When the child has been bathed, it is fumigated, and
deposited for the first time in a swinging-cot (the Malay substitute
for a cradle) which, according to immemorial custom, is formed by a
<i>black</i> cloth slung from one of the rafters. To fumigate<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18411src" href="#xd21e18411" name=
"xd21e18411src">26</a> it you take leaves of the red drac&aelig;na
(<i lang="ms">j&#277;njuang merah</i>), and wrap them round first with
the casing of the charred torch (<i lang="ms">puntong</i>) used at the
severing of the cord (<i lang="ms">p&#277;mbuang <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>tali
pusat</i>), then with leaves of the <i lang="ms">t&rsquo;rong asam</i>
(&ldquo;acid&rdquo; egg-plant), and tie them round at intervals with a
string of shredded tree-bark (<i lang="ms">tali t&rsquo;rap</i>). The
funnel-shaped bouquet thus formed is suspended above the child&rsquo;s
cot (<i lang="ms">buayan</i>); a spice-block (<i lang="ms">batu
giling</i>) is deposited inside it, and underneath it are placed the
naked blade of a cutlass (<i lang="ms">parang puting</i>), a cocoa-nut
scraper (<i lang="ms">kukoran</i>), and one of the basket-work stands
used for the cooking-pots (<i lang="ms">l&#277;kar jantan</i>), which
latter is slung round the neck of the cocoa-nut scraper. This last
strange contrivance is, I believe, intended as a hint to the evil
spirit or vampire which comes to suck the child&rsquo;s blood, and for
whom the trap described above is set underneath the house-floor.</p>
<p class="par">Now get a censer and burn incense in it, adding to the
flame, as it burns, rubbish from beneath a deserted house, the deserted
nest of a <i lang="ms">m&#277;r&rsquo;bah</i> (dove), and the deserted
nest of the &ldquo;rain-bird&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">sarang burong
ujan-ujan</i>). When all is ready, rock the cot very gently seven
times, then take the spice-block out of the cot and deposit it together
with the blade of the cutlass upon the ground, take the child in your
arms and fumigate it by moving it thrice round in a circle over the
smoke of the censer, counting up to seven as you do so, and swing the
child gently towards your left. At the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; call
the child&rsquo;s soul by saying &ldquo;Cluck, cluck! soul of Muhammad
here!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18481src" href="#xd21e18481"
name="xd21e18481src">27</a> (if it is a boy), or &ldquo;Cluck, cluck!
soul of Fatimah here!&rdquo; (if it is a girl); deposit the child in
the cot and rock it very gently, so that it does not swing farther than
the neck of the cocoa-nut scraper extends (<i lang="ms">sa-panjang
kukoran sahaja</i>). After this you may swing it as far as you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>like, but for at least seven days afterwards,
whenever the child is taken out of the cot, the spice-block, or
stone-child (<i lang="ms">anak batu</i>) as it is called, must be
deposited in the cot as a substitute for the child (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;ngganti budak</i>).</p>
<p class="par">Once in every four hours the child should be bathed with
cold water, in order that it may be kept &ldquo;cool.&rdquo; This
custom, I was told, is diametrically opposite to that which obtains at
Malacca, where the child is bathed as rarely as possible. The custom
followed in Selangor is said to prevent the child from getting a sore
mouth (<i lang="ms">guam</i>).</p>
<p class="par">For the first two months or so, whenever the child is
bathed, it is rubbed over with a paste obtained by mixing powdered rice
with the powder obtained from a red stone called <i lang="ms">batu
kawi</i>. This stone, which is said by some Malays to take its name
from the Island of Langkawi, is thought to possess astringent (<i lang=
"ms">k&rsquo;lat</i>) qualities, and is used by Malay women to improve
their skin. Before use the paste is fumigated with the smoke of burning
eagle-wood, sandal-wood, and incense, after which the liquid, which is
said to resemble red ink, is applied to the skin, and then washed off,
no doubt, with lime-juice in the ordinary way.</p>
<p class="par">In the cold water which is used for bathing the child
are deposited a big iron nail (as a &ldquo;symbol of iron&rdquo;),
&ldquo;candle-nuts&rdquo; and cockle-shells (<i lang="ms">kulit
k&rsquo;rang</i>), to which some Malays add a kind of parasite called
<i lang="ms">si b&#277;r&rsquo;nas</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Well-Filled Out, a
word applied to children who are fat, instead of the word <i lang=
"ms">g&#277;mok</i>, which is considered unlucky) and another parasite
called <i lang="ms">sadingin</i> or <i lang="ms">si dingin</i>, the
&ldquo;Cold&rdquo; one.</p>
<p class="par">After bathing, the Bidan should perform the ceremony
called <i lang="ms">s&#277;mbor sirih</i>, which consists in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>ejecting of betel-leaf (mixed with other
ingredients) out of her mouth on to the pit of the child&rsquo;s
stomach, the ingredients being pounded leaves of the <i lang=
"ms">bunglei</i>, <i lang="ms">ch&#277;kor</i>, and <i lang=
"ms">j&#277;rangau</i>, and chips of brazil-wood, ebony, and sugar-palm
twigs (<i lang="ms">s&#277;gar kabong</i>); to these are sometimes
added small portions of the &ldquo;Rough&rdquo; bamboo (<i lang=
"ms">buluh kasap</i>), of the <i lang="ms">b&#277;mban balu</i>, and of
the leaf-cases of the areca-palm (either <i lang="ms">upih b&rsquo;lah
batang</i> or <i lang="ms">upih sarong</i>).</p>
<p class="par">The child is generally named within the first week, but
I have not yet heard of any special ceremony connected with the naming,
though it is most probably considered as a religious act. The name is
evidently considered of some importance, for if the child happens to
get ill directly after the naming, it is sometimes re-adopted
(temporarily) by a third party, who gives it a different name. When
this happens a species of bracelets and anklets made of black cloth are
put upon the child&rsquo;s wrists and ankles, the ceremony being called
<i lang="ms">tumpang sayang</i>.</p>
<p class="par">A few days later the child&rsquo;s head is shaved, and
his nails cut for the first time. For the former process a red lather
is manufactured from fine rice-flour mixed with gambier, lime, and
betel-leaf. Some people have the child&rsquo;s head shaved clean,
others leave the central lock (<i lang="ms">jambul</i>). In either case
the remains of the red lather, together with the clippings of hair (and
nails?) are received in a rolled-up yam-leaf (<i lang="ms">daun
k&rsquo;ladi di-ponjut</i>) or cocoa-nut (?), and carried away and
deposited at the foot of a shady tree, such as a banana (or a
pomegranate?).</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes (as had been done in the case of a Malay bride
at whose &ldquo;tonsure&rdquo; I assisted<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18579src" href="#xd21e18579" name="xd21e18579src">28</a>), the
parents <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>make a vow at a child&rsquo;s birth that they
will give a feast at the tonsure of its hair, just before its marriage,
provided the child grows up in safety.</p>
<p class="par">Occasionally the ceremony of shaving the child&rsquo;s
head takes place on the 44th day after birth, the ceremony being called
<i lang="ms">balik juru</i>. A small sum, such as $2.00 or $3.00, is
also sometimes presented to a pilgrim to carry clippings of the
child&rsquo;s locks to Mecca and cast them into the well Zemzem, such
payment being called <i lang="ms">&rsquo;k&ecirc;kah</i> (<i lang=
"ms">&#703;ak&ecirc;kah</i>) in the case of a boy, and <i lang=
"ms">k&#277;rban</i> in the case of a girl.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">To return to the mother. She is bathed in hot water at 8
o&rsquo;clock each morning for three days, and from the day of birth
(after ablution) she has to undergo the strangest ceremony of all,
&ldquo;ascending the roasting-place&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">naik
saleian</i>). A kind of rough couch is prepared upon a small platform
(<i lang="ms">saleian</i>), which is about six feet in length, and
slopes downwards towards the foot, where it is about two feet above the
floor. Beneath this platform a fireplace or hearth (<i lang=
"ms">dapor</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18626src" href="#xd21e18626"
name="xd21e18626src">30</a> is constructed, and a &ldquo;roaring
fire&rdquo; lighted, which is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343"
href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>intended to warm the patient
to a degree consistent with Malay ideas of what is beneficial! Custom,
which is stronger than law, forces the patient to recline upon this
couch two or three times in the course of the day, and to remain upon
it each time for an hour or two. To such extremes is this practice
carried, that &ldquo;on one occasion a poor woman was brought to the
point of death ... and would have died if she had not been rescued by
the kind interposition of the Civil Assistant-Surgeon; the excessive
excitement caused by the heat was so overpowering that aberration of
mind ensued which continued for several months.&rdquo;<a class=

<p class="par">As if this were not enough, one of the heated
hearth-stones (<i lang="ms">batu tungku</i>) is frequently wrapped up
in a piece of flannel or old rags, applied to the patient&rsquo;s
stomach so as to &ldquo;roast&rdquo; her still more effectually. This
&ldquo;roasting&rdquo; custom is said to continue for the whole of the
forty-four days of uncleanness. During this period there are many
birth-taboos (<i lang="ms">pantang b&#277;ranak</i>) applying to food,
the following articles being usually forbidden: (1) things which have
(from the Malay point of view) a lowering effect on the constitution
(<i lang="ms">sagala yang s&#277;juk-s&#277;juk</i>), <i>e.g.</i>
fruits, with some exceptions, and vegetables; (2) things which have a

taken from Mr. H. Clifford&rsquo;s <i>Studies in Brown Humanity</i>,
will give a good general idea of this part of the subject:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When Umat has placed the <i lang=
"ms">s&icirc;rih</i> leaves he has done all he can for
S&#277;l&#277;ma, and he resigns himself to endure the anxiety of the
next few months with the patience of which he has so much command. The
<i lang="ms">pantang b&#277;r-&acirc;nak</i>, or birth-taboos, hem a
husband in almost as rigidly as they do his wife, and Umat, who is as
superstitious as are all the Malays of the lower classes, is filled
with fear lest he should unwittingly transgress any law, the breach of
which might cost S&#277;l&#277;ma her life. He no longer shaves his
head periodically, as he loves to do, for a naked scalp is very cool
and comfortable; he does not even cut his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>hair, and a thick
black shock stands five inches high upon his head, and tumbles raggedly
about his neck and ears. S&#277;l&#277;ma is his first wife, and never
before has she borne children, wherefore no hair of her husband&rsquo;s
must be trimmed until her days are accomplished. Umat will not kill the
fowls for the cook now, nor even drive a stray dog from the compound
with violence, lest he should chance to maim it, for he must shed no
blood, and must do no hurt to any living thing during all this time.
One day he is sent on an errand up-river and is absent until the third
day. On inquiry it appears that he passed the night in a friend&rsquo;s
house, and on the morrow found that the wife of his host was shortly
expecting to become a mother. Therefore he had to remain at least two
nights in the village. Why? Because if he failed to do so,
S&#277;l&#277;ma would die. Why would she die? God alone knows, but
such is the teaching of the men of old, the wise ones of ancient days.
But Umat&rsquo;s chief privation is that he is forbidden to sit in the
doorway of his house. To understand what this means to a Malay, you
must realise that the seat in the doorway, at the head of the
stair-ladder that reaches to the ground, is to him much what the
fireside is to the English peasant. It is here that he sits and looks
out patiently at life, as the European gazes into the heart of the
fire. It is here that his neighbours come to gossip with him, and it is
in the doorway of his own or his friend&rsquo;s house that the echo of
the world is borne to his ears. But, while S&#277;l&#277;ma is ill,
Umat may not block the doorway, or dreadful consequences will ensue,
and though he appreciates this and makes the sacrifice readily for his
wife&rsquo;s sake, it takes much of the comfort out of his life.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;S&#277;l&#277;ma, meanwhile, has to be equally
circumspect. She bridles her woman&rsquo;s tongue resolutely, and no
word in disparagement of man or beast passes her lips during all these
months, for she has no desire to see the qualities she dislikes
reproduced in the child. She is often tired to death and faint and ill
before her hour draws nigh, but none the less she will not lie upon her
mat during the daytime lest her heavy eyes should close in sleep, since
her child would surely fall a prey to evil spirits were she to do so.
Therefore she fights on to the dusk, and Umat does all he can to
comfort her and to lighten her sufferings by constant tenderness and
care.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18772src" href="#xd21e18772"
name="xd21e18772src">33</a></p>
<p class="par">The medicine (<i lang="ms">sambaran bara</i>), used by
the mother after her confinement, consists of the ashes of a burnt
cocoa-nut shell pounded and mixed with a pinch of black pepper
(<i lang="ms">lada hitam sa-jimput</i>), a root of garlic (<i lang=
"ms">bawang puteh sa-labuh</i>), and enough vinegar to make the mixture
liquid. This potion is drunk for three consecutive mornings. A bandage
is swathed about her waist, and she is treated with a cosmetic
(<i lang="ms">b&#277;dak</i>) manufactured from <i lang="ms">t&#277;mu
kuning</i>, which is pounded small (and mixed as before with garlic,
black pepper, and vinegar), and applied every morning and evening for
the first three days. During the next three days a new cosmetic
(<i lang="ms">b&#277;dak kunyit t&rsquo;rus</i>) is applied, the
ingredients being <i lang="ms">kunyit t&rsquo;rus</i> pounded and mixed
in the same way as the cosmetic just described.</p>
<p class="par">At the same time the patient is given a potion made from
the ash of burnt durian skins (<i lang="ms">abu kulit durian</i>),
mixed as before with vinegar; the fruit-stalk, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>or
&ldquo;spire,&rdquo; of a cocoa-nut palm (<i lang="ms">manggar
niyor</i>) being substituted if the durian skin is not obtainable.</p>
<p class="par">A poultice (<i lang="ms">ubat pupok</i>) is also applied
to the patient&rsquo;s forehead, after the early bathing, during the
&ldquo;forty-four days&rdquo; of her retirement; it consists of leaves
of the <i lang="ms">tahi babi</i>, <i lang="ms">jintan hitam</i>, and
garlic, pounded and mixed as usual with vinegar.</p>
<p class="par">After three days an extraordinary mixture, called in
Selangor the &ldquo;Hundred Herbs&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">r&#277;mpah
&rsquo;ratus</i>), but in Malacca merely &ldquo;Pot-herbs&rdquo;
(<i lang="ms">r&#277;mpah p&rsquo;riok</i>), is concocted from all
kinds of herbs, roots, and spices. The ingredients are put into a large
vessel of water and left to soak, a portion of the liquor being
strained off and given to the patient as a potion every morning for
about ten days. Similar ingredients boiled in a large pot, which is
kept hot by being hermetically sealed (<i lang=
"ms">di-g&#277;tang</i>), and by having live embers placed underneath
it from time to time, furnish the regular beverage of the patient up to
the time of her purification. After the first fortnight, however, the
lees are extracted from the vessel and used to compose a poultice which
is applied to the patient&rsquo;s waist, a set of fresh ingredients
replacing the old ones.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18835src" href=
"#xd21e18835" name="xd21e18835src">34</a> It is sold for fifty cents a
jar.</p>
<p class="par">On the forty-fourth day the raised platform or
roasting-place (<i lang="ms">saleian</i>) is taken down and the
ceremony called Floor-washing (<i lang="ms">basoh lantei</i>) takes
place, the whole house being thoroughly washed and cleaned.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>The floor having been smeared with rice-cosmetic
(<i lang="ms">b&#277;dak</i>) (such as the Malays use for the bathing
ceremony), it is well scratched by the claws of a fowl, which is caught
(and washed) for the purpose, and then held over the floor and forced
to do the scratching required of it. The cosmetic is then removed
(<i lang="ms">di-langir</i>) by means of lime-juice (again as in the
bathing ceremony) and the hearth-fire is changed. The Bidan now
receives her pay, usually getting in cash for the eldest child $4.40
(in some places $5.40), for the second, $3.40, the third, $2.40, and
for the fourth, and all subsequent children, $1.40; unless she is
hastily summoned (<i lang="ms">bidan tarek</i>) and no engagement
(<i lang="ms">m&#277;n&#277;mpah</i>) has been made, in which case she
may demand half a <i lang="ms">bhara</i> ($11). Besides this somewhat
meagre remuneration, however, she receives from the well-to-do (at the
floor-washing ceremony) such presents as cast-off clothes (<i lang=
"ms">kain b&#277;kas tuboh</i>), a bowl of saffron rice, a bowl of the
rice-cosmetic and limes (<i lang="ms">b&#277;dak limau</i>), and a
platter of betel-leaf, with accessories (<i lang="ms">ch&#277;rana
sirih</i>). Though the remuneration may appear small, it was,
nevertheless, sure; as in former days an unwritten law allowed her to
take the child and &ldquo;cry it for sale&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">di-jaja</i>) round the country, should her fee remain unpaid.</p>
<p class="par">Before concluding the present subject it will be
necessary to describe certain specific injunctions and taboos which
form an important part of the vast body of Malay customs which centre
specially round the birth of children.</p>
<p class="par">Before the child is born the father has to be more than
usually circumspect with regard to what he does, as any untoward act on
his part would assuredly have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349"
href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>a prejudicial effect on the
child, and cause a birth-mark or even actual deformity, any such
affection being called <i lang="ms">k&#277;nan</i>. In a case which
came to my notice the son was born with only a thumb, forefinger, and
little finger on the left hand, and a great toe on the left foot, the
rest of the fingers and toes on the left side being wanting. This, I
was told, was due to the fact that the father violated this taboo by
going to the fishing-stakes one day and killing a crab by chopping at
it with a cutlass.</p>
<p class="par">In former days during this period it was
&ldquo;taboo&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">pantang</i>) for the father to cut
the throat of a buffalo or even of a fowl; or, in fact, to take the
life of any animal whatever&mdash;a trace no doubt of Indian
influences. A Malay told me once that his son, soon after birth, was
afflicted with a great obstruction of breathing, but that when the
medicine-man (<i lang="ms">Pawang</i>) declared (after
&ldquo;diagnosing&rdquo; the case) that the child was suffering from a
&ldquo;fish-affection&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">k&#277;nan ikan</i>), he
remembered that he had knocked on the head an extraordinary number of
fish which he had caught on the very day that his son was born. He
therefore, by the advice of the medicine-man, gave the child a potion
made from pounded fish bones, and an immediate and permanent recovery
was the result.</p>
<p class="par">Such affections as those described are classified by the
Malays according to the kind of influence which is supposed to have
produced them. Thus the unoffending victim may be either fish-struck
(<i lang="ms">k&#277;nan ikan</i>), as described above, ape-struck
(<i lang="ms">k&#277;nan b&rsquo;rok</i>), dog-struck (<i lang=
"ms">k&#277;nan anjing</i>), crab-struck (<i lang="ms">k&#277;nan
k&#277;tam</i>), and so forth, it being maintained that in every case
the child either displays some physical deformity, causing a
resemblance to the animal by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href=
"#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span>which it was affected, or else
(and more commonly) unconsciously imitates its actions or its
&ldquo;voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Another interesting custom was that the father was
stringently forbidden to cut his hair until after the birth of the
child.</p>
<p class="par">The following passage bearing on the subject is taken
from Sir W. E. Maxwell&rsquo;s article on the &ldquo;Folklore of the
Malays&rdquo;:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19021src" href="#xd21e19021"
name="xd21e19021src">35</a>&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In selecting timber for the uprights of a Malay
house care must be taken to reject any log which is indented by the
pressure of any parasitic creeper which may have wound round it when it
was a living tree. A log so marked, if used in building a house, will
exercise an unfavourable influence in childbirth, protracting delivery
and endangering the lives of mother and child. Many precautions must be
taken to guard against evil influence of a similar kind, when one of
the inmates of a house is expecting to become a mother. No one may
&lsquo;divide the house&rsquo; (<i lang="ms">b&#277;lah rumah</i>),
that is, go in at the front door and out at the back, or <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>, nor may any guest or stranger be entertained in the
house for one night only; he must be detained for a second night to
complete an even period. If an eclipse <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e19037" title="Source: occur">occurs</span>, the woman on whose
account these observances are necessary must be taken into the <i lang=
"ms">p&#277;nangga</i> (kitchen), and placed beneath the shelf or
platform (<i lang="ms">para</i>) on which the domestic utensils are
kept. A spoon is put into her hand. If these precautions are not taken,
the child when born will be deformed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sir W. E. Maxwell in the above is speaking of Perak
Malays. The passage just quoted applies to a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>great extent to Selangor, but with a few
discrepancies. Thus a house-post indented by a creeper is generally
avoided in Selangor for a different reason, viz. that it is supposed to
bring snakes into the house.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dividing the house,&rdquo; however, is generally
considered an important birth-taboo in Selangor, the threatened penalty
for its non-observance being averted by compelling the guilty party to
submit to the unpleasant ceremony called <i lang="ms">s&#277;mbor
ayer</i>, a member of the family being required to eject (<i lang=
"ms">s&#277;mbor</i>) a mouthful of water upon the small of the
culprit&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p class="par">In Selangor, again, a guest must stay <i>three</i>
nights (not <i>two</i>) in the house, his departure on the first or
second night being called &ldquo;Insulting the Night&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">m&#277;njolok malam</i>). To avert the evil consequences of such
an act, fumigation (<i lang="ms">rabun-rabun</i>) is resorted to, the
&ldquo;recipe&rdquo; for it running as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Take
assaf&oelig;tida, sulphur, <i lang="ms">kunyit t&rsquo;rus</i> (an
evil-smelling root), onion skins, dried areca-nut husk, lemon-grass
leaves, and an old mat or cloth, burn them, and leave the ashes for
about an hour at sunset on the floor of the passage in front of the
door.&rdquo; That a sensible and self-respecting &ldquo;demon&rdquo;
should avoid a house where such an unconscionable odour is raised is
not in the least surprising!</p>
<p class="par">In the event of an eclipse the customs of the two sister
States appear to be nearly identical; the only difference being that in
Selangor the woman is placed in the doorway (in the moonlight as far as
possible), and is furnished with the basket-work stand of a cooking
pot, as well as a wooden rice-spoon, the former as a trap to catch any
unwary demon who may be so foolish as to put his head &ldquo;into the
noose,&rdquo; and the latter as a weapon of offence, it being supposed
that &ldquo;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352"
name="pb352">352</a>]</span>rattan binding of the spoon (which must, of
course, be of the orthodox Malay pattern) will unwind itself and
entangle the assailant&rdquo; in the case of any real danger. Finally,
the Bidan must be present to &ldquo;massage&rdquo; the woman, and
repeat the necessary charms.</p>
<p class="par">From the following passage it would appear that the
corresponding Pahang custom does not materially differ from that of
Perak and Selangor:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But during the period that the Moon&rsquo;s fate
hung in the balance, S&#277;l&#277;ma has suffered many things. She has
been seated motionless in the fireplace under the tray-like shelf,
which hangs from the low rafters, trembling with terror of&mdash;she
knows not what. The little basket-work stand, on which the hot rice-pot
is wont to rest, is worn on her head as a cap, and in her girdle the
long wooden rice-spoon is stuck dagger-wise. Neither she nor Umat know
why these things are done, but they never dream of questioning their
necessity. It is the custom. The men of olden days have decreed that
women with child should do these things when the Moon is in trouble,
and the consequences of neglect are too terrible to be risked; so
S&#277;l&#277;ma and Umat act according to their simple
faith.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19084src" href="#xd21e19084"

<p class="par first">Of the purely Malay ceremonies performed at
Adolescence, the most important are the &ldquo;filing of the
teeth&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">b&#277;rasah gigi</i>),<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e19100src" href="#xd21e19100" name="xd21e19100src">37</a> and
the cutting of the first locks of hair, in cases where this latter
operation has been postponed till the child&rsquo;s marriage by a vow
of its parents. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353"
name="pb353">353</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The following is a description of the rite of tonsure
(<i lang="ms">b&#277;rchukor</i>), at which I was present in
person:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Some time ago (in 1897) I received, through one
of my local Malay headmen, an invitation to attend a tonsure
ceremony.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When I arrived (about two <span class=
"sc">P.M.</span>), in company of the headman referred to, the usual
dancing and Kor&#257;n-chanting was proceeding in the outer chamber or
verandah, which was decked out for the occasion with the usual
brilliantly coloured ceiling-cloth and striped wall-tapestry. After a
short interval we were invited to enter an inner room, where a number
of Malays of both sexes were awaiting the performance of the rite. The
first thing, however, that caught the eye was a gracefully-draped
figure standing with shrouded head, and with its back to the company,
upon the lowest step of the dais (<i lang="ms">g&rsquo;rei</i>), which
had been erected with a view to the prospective wedding ceremony. This
was the bride. A dark-coloured veil, thrown over her head and
shoulders, allowed seven luxuriant tresses of her wonderful raven-black
hair to escape and roll down below her waist, a ring of precious metal
being attached to the end of each tress. Close to the bride, and ready
to support her, should she require it, in her motherly arms, stood the
(on such occasions) familiar figure of the Duenna (<i lang="ms">Mak
Inang</i>), whose duty, however, in the present instance was confined
to taking the left hand of the bride between her own, and supporting it
in a horizontal position whilst each of the seven Representatives
(<i lang="ms">orang waris</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19128src"
href="#xd21e19128" name="xd21e19128src">38</a> in turn was sprinkling
it with the &lsquo;Neutralising Rice-paste&rsquo; (<i lang=
"ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>) by means of the usual bunch <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>or
brush of leaves. A little in front of this pair stood a youth
supporting in his hands an unhusked cocoa-nut shell. The crown of this
cocoa-nut had been removed, and the edges at the top cut in such a way
as to form a chevroned or &lsquo;dog-tooth&rsquo; border. Upon the
indentations of this rim was deposited a necklace, and a large pair of
scissors about the size of a tailor&rsquo;s shears were stuck point
downwards in the rim. The cocoa-nut itself was perhaps half-filled with
its &lsquo;milk.&rsquo; Close to this youth stood another, supporting
one of the usual circular brass trays (with high sides) containing all
the ordinary accessories of the <i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>
ceremony, <i>i.e.</i> a bowl of rice-paste, a brush of leaves, parched
rice, washed saffron-stained rice, and benzoin or incense.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was now requested to open the proceedings, but
at my express desire the P&#277;nghulu (Malay headman) did so for me,
first scattering several handfuls (of the different sorts of rice) over
the bride, and then sprinkling the rice-paste upon the palm of her left
hand, which was held out to receive it as described above. The
sprinkling over, he took the scissors and with great deliberation
severed the end of the first lock, which was made to fall with a little
splash, and with the ring attached to it, into the cocoa-nut with the
&lsquo;dog-tooth&rsquo; border.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Five other <i lang="ms">waris</i>
(Representatives) and myself followed suit, the seven tresses with the
rings attached to them being all received in the cocoa-nut as
described.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A child of the age of about two or three years
underwent the tonsure at the same time, each of the Representatives,
after severing the bride&rsquo;s lock, snipping off a portion of the
child&rsquo;s hair. The child was in arms and was not veiled, but wore
a shoulder-cloth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355"
name="pb355">355</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">bidak</i>) thrown over his
shoulder. At the conclusion of the ceremony we left the room, and the
Kor&#257;n-chanting was resumed and continued until the arrival of the
bridegroom in procession (at about five <span class="sc">P.M.</span>),
when the bride and bridegroom went through the ceremony of being
&lsquo;seated side by side&rsquo; (<i lang="ms">b&#277;rsanding</i>),
and the business of the day was concluded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The cocoa-nut containing the severed tresses and
rings is carried to the foot of a barren fruit-tree (<i>e.g.</i> a
pomegranate-tree), when the rings are extracted and the water (with the
severed locks) poured out at the tree&rsquo;s foot, the belief being
that this proceeding will <i>make the tree as luxuriant as the hair of
the person shorn</i>, a very clear example of &lsquo;sympathetic
magic.&rsquo; If the parents are poor, the cocoa-nut is generally
turned upside down and left there; but if they are well-to-do, the
locks are usually sent to Mecca in charge of a pilgrim, who casts them
on his arrival into the well Zemzem.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I will now describe the ceremony of filing or
&ldquo;sharpening&rdquo; the teeth, from notes taken by myself during
the actual ceremony (20th March, 1897).</p>
<p class="par">The youth whose teeth I saw filed must have been quite
fifteen or sixteen years of age, and had not long before undergone the
rite of circumcision. When I arrived I found the house newly swept and
clean, and all the accessories of the ceremony already prepared. These
latter consisted of a round tray (<i lang="ms">dulang</i>) containing
the usual bowl of rice-paste (<i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>), with
the brush of leaves,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19184src" href=
"#xd21e19184" name="xd21e19184src">39</a> three cups (containing
different sorts of rice), an egg,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19206src"
href="#xd21e19206" name="xd21e19206src">40</a> three rings <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span>of
precious metals (gold, silver, and amalgam), a couple of limes, and two
small files (to which a small tooth-saw and two small whetstones should
be added).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19220src" href="#xd21e19220"
name="xd21e19220src">41</a></p>
<p class="par">The ceremony now commences: the tooth-filer (<i lang=
"ms">Pawang gigi</i>) first scatters the three sorts of rice and
sprinkles the <i lang="ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i> upon his instruments,
etc., repeating the proper charm<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19260src"
href="#xd21e19260" name="xd21e19260src">42</a> at the same time; the
patient meanwhile, and throughout the operation, reclining upon his
back on the floor with his head resting on a pillow. Next the Pawang,
sitting beside the patient, &ldquo;touches&rdquo; the patient&rsquo;s
teeth, first with each of the three rings of precious metal and then
with the egg, throwing each of these objects away as he does so, and
repeating each time a charm (<i lang="ms">Hu, kata Allah, d. s.
b.</i>), which is given in the Appendix. Next he props open (<i lang=
"ms">di-s&#277;ngkang</i>) the patient&rsquo;s mouth by means of a
dried areca-nut, and repeats another charm (<i lang="ms">Hei,
Bismi</i>) in order to destroy the &ldquo;venom&rdquo; of the steel,
laying the file upon the teeth,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19278src"
href="#xd21e19278" name="xd21e19278src">43</a> and drawing it thrice
across them at the end of the charm. He then cuts off (<i lang=
"ms">di-k&rsquo;rat</i>) the crowns of the teeth (with one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>of
the files), smooths their edges (<i lang="ms">di-papar</i>) with one of
the whetstones, and polishes them (<i lang="ms">m&#277;lechek</i>).
During the whole of this part of the performance, which is a trying
ordeal to witness, although it is borne with the utmost fortitude on
the part of the sufferer, the latter holds a small mirror in front of
his mouth in order to be assured that the operation is progressing to
his satisfaction. When the actual filing is over, the areca-nut is
extracted, and a piece of cocoa-nut husk or small block of <i lang=
"ms">pulai</i> wood inserted in its stead, in order to facilitate the
proper polishing of the now mutilated teeth. This latter part of the
operation is accomplished by means of the file, a small piece of folded
white cloth protecting the lips from injury.</p>
<p class="par">Considerable interest attaches to the filing of the
first tooth, on account of the omens which are taken from the position
in which the crown happens to lie when it falls. If, when the tooth is
filed through, the crown adheres to the file, it is taken as a sign
that the patient will die at home; if it flies off and lies with its
edge turned upwards, this means, on the contrary, that he will die
abroad.</p>
<p class="par">At the conclusion of the operation a species of poultice
(<i lang="ms">ubat tasak</i>), consisting mainly of cooked ginger
(<i lang="ms">halia bara di-pahis-ki</i>), which is intended to
&ldquo;deaden (the feeling of) the gums&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">matikan
daging gusi</i>) is duly charmed<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19314src"
href="#xd21e19314" name="xd21e19314src">44</a> and applied to the gums
of the jaw which happens to be under treatment. The Pawang now lays one
hand (the left) on the top of the patient&rsquo;s head and the other
upon the teeth of the upper jaw, and presses them together with a show
of considerable force, making believe, as it were, that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>he
is pressing the patient&rsquo;s upper teeth firmly into their sockets.
Finally, a portion of betel-leaf is charmed (with the charm <i lang=
"ms">Hong sarangin</i>, etc.) and given to the patient to chew, after
which, it is asserted, all pain immediately ceases. The Pawang then
washes his hands, resharpens his tools, and those present sit down to a
meal of saffron-stained <i lang="ms">pulut</i> rice. This concludes the
ceremony for the day, the lower jaw being similarly treated upon a
subsequent occasion.</p>
<p class="par">In the course of three such operations (the Pawang
informed me) the teeth can be filed down even with the gums, in which
case they are, I believe, in some instances somewhat roughly plated or
cased with gold. Sometimes, however, they are merely filed into points,
so that they resemble the teeth of a shark.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e19333src" href="#xd21e19333" name="xd21e19333src">45</a> Very
frequently, too, they blacken them with a mixture of the empyreumatic
oil of the cocoa-nut shell (<i lang="ms">baja</i> or <i lang=
"ms">g&rsquo;rang</i>) and <i lang="ms">kamunting</i> (Kl. <i lang=
"ms">karamunting</i>) wood,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19352src" href=
"#xd21e19352" name="xd21e19352src">46</a> which is also used for
blackening the eyebrows. These customs, however, are already dying out
in the more civilised Malay States. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb359" href="#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Whenever I made inquiries as to the reason of this
strange custom, I was invariably told that it not only beautified but
preserved the teeth from the action of decay, which the Malays believe
to be set up by the presence of a minute maggot or worm (<i lang=
"ms">ulat</i>), their most usual way of expressing the fact that they
are suffering from toothache being to say that the tooth in question is
being &ldquo;eaten by a maggot&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">di-makan
ulat</i>).</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;Batak&rdquo; Malays (a Mid-Sumatran tribe,
many of whom have settled in Kuala Langat) are said to chip the teeth
of their children into the desired shape by the use of a small chisel,
the operation causing such exquisite agony that the sufferer will not
unfrequently leap to his feet with a shriek.</p>
<p class="par">Even when the file is used, the work of an unskilful
performer (who does not know how to destroy the &ldquo;venom&rdquo; of
his instruments) will cause the sufferer&rsquo;s face to be completely
swollen up (<i lang="ms">bakup</i>) for a long period subsequent to the
operation. Yet young people of both sexes cheerfully submit to the risk
of this discomfort, and the only remark made by the youth whom I saw
undergoing it was that it &ldquo;made his mouth feel
uncomfortable&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">j&#277;lejeh rasa
mulut-nya</i>).</p>
<p class="par">The ear-boring ceremony (<i lang=
"ms">b&#277;rtindek</i>) appears to have already lost much of its
ceremonial character in Selangor, where I was told that it is now
usually performed when the child is quite small, <i>i.e.</i> at the
earliest, when the child is some five or seven months old, and when it
is about a year old at the latest, whereas in Sumatra (according to
Marsden) it is not performed until the child is eight or nine.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e19394src" href="#xd21e19394" name=
"xd21e19394src">47</a> Still, however, a special kind <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span>of
round ear-ring, which is of filagree-work, and is called <i lang=
"ms">subang</i>, is as much the emblem of virginity in the western
States as it ever was. The &ldquo;discarding&rdquo; of these ear-rings
(<i lang="ms">tanggal subang</i>), which should take place about seven
days after the conclusion of the marriage rites, is ceremonial in
character, and it is even the custom when a widow (<i lang=
"ms">janda</i>) is married for the second time, to provide her with a
pair of <i lang="ms">subang</i> (which should, however, it is said, be
<i>tied</i> on to her ears instead of being inserted in the ear-holes,
as in the case of a girl who has never been married).</p>
<p class="par">The rite of circumcision is of course common to
Muhammadans all over the world. Some analogous practices, however, have
also been noticed among the non-Muhammadan Malayan races of the Eastern
Archipelago, and it is at least doubtful whether circumcision as now
practised by Malays is a purely Muhummadan rite. Among Malays it is
performed by a functionary called the &ldquo;Mudim,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e19428src" href="#xd21e19428" name=
"xd21e19428src">48</a> with a slip of bamboo, at any age (in the case
of boys) from about six or seven up to about sixteen years, the wound
being often dressed (at least in town districts) with fine clay mixed
with soot and the yolk of eggs, but when possible, the clay is mixed
with cocoa-nut fibre (<i lang="ms">rabok niyor</i>), <i lang=
"ms">s&#277;lumur paku uban</i>, and the young shoots of the <i lang=
"ms">k&rsquo;lat</i> plantain (<i lang="ms">puchok pisang
k&rsquo;lat</i>), the compound being called in either case <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span><i lang="ms">ubat tasak</i>. The ceremony is
associated with the common purificatory rite called <i lang=
"ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>, and with <i lang="ms">ayer tolak bala</i>
(lit. evil-dispelling water). Lights are kept burning in the house for
several days (&ldquo;until the wound has healed&rdquo;), and the
performance of the ceremony is always made the occasion for a banquet,
together with music and dancing of the kind in which Malays take so
much delight. The cause of these rejoicings is dressed for the occasion
&ldquo;like a bridegroom&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">p&#277;ngantin</i>), and
is said to be sometimes carried in procession.</p>

<p class="par first">Ceremonies and charms for protecting or rendering
the person more attractive or formidable, form one of the largest, but
not perhaps the most interesting or important division of the
medicine-man&rsquo;s repertory.</p>
<p class="par">The following remarkable specimen of the charms
belonging to the first of these classes was given me by &rsquo;Che

of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>charms shows particularly strong traces of
Arabic influence, most often, perhaps, taking the form of an injunction
(addressed to Jins or Angels) to watch over the person of the
petitioner.</p>
<p class="par">To rightly understand charms of the second class, which

have some idea of the Malay standard of beauty. This, I need hardly
say, differs widely from that entertained by Europeans. In the case of
manly beauty we should, perhaps, be able to acquiesce to some extent in
the admiration which Malays express for &ldquo;Brightness of
Countenance&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">chahia</i>), which forms one of the
chief objects of petition in almost every one of this class of
charms;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19526src" href="#xd21e19526" name=

Ophir, Tuan P&#365;tri Gunong Ledang, to secure perpetual youth), the
petitioner boasts that he (or she) was &ldquo;born under the Inverted
Banyan Tree,&rdquo; and claims the granting of the boon applied for
&ldquo;by virtue of the use of the &ldquo;Black L&#277;nggundi

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Betrothal is called <i lang="ms">tunangan</i> or
<i lang="ms">pinangan</i>. When the parents of a marriageable youth
perceive a suitable &ldquo;match&rdquo; for their son, they send a
messenger to her parents to ask if she has yet been
&ldquo;bespoken&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">kalau ada orang s&#277;but</i>).
If the reply is satisfactory, the messenger is again despatched to
intimate the desire of the youth&rsquo;s parents to
&ldquo;bespeak&rdquo; the hand of the favoured individual for his son,
and to arrange a day for a meeting. These preliminaries are accompanied
by the usual polite self-depreciation on both sides. Thus, the
girl&rsquo;s father begins by saying, &ldquo;You wish to bespeak the
hand of my daughter, who knows neither how to cook nor how to
sew&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">yang ta&rsquo;tahu masak, ta&rsquo;tahu
m&#277;njait</i>). But the custom is not carried to such extremes as it
is in China.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19665src" href="#xd21e19665"
name="xd21e19665src">68</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href=

<p class="par">The girl&rsquo;s parents next call four or five
witnesses (<i lang="ms">saksi</i>) of either sex to
&ldquo;witness&rdquo; the betrothal, and after preparing a meal
(<i lang="ms">nasi dan kueh</i>) for their expected guests, await the
arrival of the youth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Representatives,&rdquo; the youth
himself remaining at home. One of the party carries a betel-leaf tray
furnished with the usual betel-chewing appliances, together with half a
<i lang="ms">bhara</i> of dollars ($11) according to the stricter
custom; although (failing the dollars), a ring or bracelet, or other
jewellery of that value, may be substituted.</p>

Gifts.</span></p>
<p class="par first">Bird-shaped receptacles, formerly used for
containing rice for presentation purposes during betrothal, the bird at
the bottom representing a peacock (<i lang="ms">m&#277;rak</i>). Round
its neck are hung two smaller receptacles also for rice.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Page 365.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Bearing these presents with them, the youth&rsquo;s
representatives proceed to the house of the girl&rsquo;s parents, where
they are invited to enter and partake of the betel-leaf provided for
them. A meal is then served, Malay cakes (<i lang="ms">kueh-kueh</i>)
brought forward, and the company again partake of betel.</p>
<p class="par">The two parties now sit down in a &ldquo;family
circle,&rdquo; and one of the youth&rsquo;s representatives pushes
forward (<i lang="ms">di-sorongkan</i>) the betel which they had
brought with them, and offers it to the people of the house, saying,
&ldquo;This is a pledge of your daughter&rsquo;s betrothal.&rdquo; The
girl&rsquo;s father replies, &ldquo;Be it so, I accept it,&rdquo; or
words to that effect, and inquires how long the engagement is to last,
the answer being &ldquo;six months&rdquo; or &ldquo;a year&rdquo; as
the case may be. Both parties then appeal to the witnesses to
&ldquo;hear what is said,&rdquo; and the youth&rsquo;s relatives return
to their homes.</p>
<p class="par">The marriage portion being fixed (in Selangor) by an
almost universal custom at two <i lang="ms">bharas</i> of dollars
($44), the amount is not usually mentioned at the betrothal, it being
understood that the usual amount is intended. But if the girl&rsquo;s
parents should afterwards prove reluctant to proceed with the match,
they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>forfeit twice the amount of the pledge-money
which they have received; whereas if the youth refuses to proceed he
merely forfeits the pledge-money ($11) already paid to the girl&rsquo;s
parents. Some families pay a marriage portion of $30 only, and others
(such as the family of &rsquo;Toh Kaya K&#277;chil of Klang) pay as
much as $50, but exceptions are rare, $44 being now generally
recognised as the customary wedding portion.</p>
<p class="par">However, the girl&rsquo;s family does not really receive
anything like the full value of the $44, because if the $44 is paid in
full the proposer has a right to demand a complete outfit (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;rsalinan</i>) of silk attire, to the value of about $20, so
that the amount which actually changes hands is seldom more than about
$24.</p>

period of betrothal.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Page 366.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The Malay <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, unlike her European
sister, is at the utmost pains to keep <i>out</i> of her lover&rsquo;s
way, and to attain this object she is said to be &ldquo;as watchful as
a tiger.&rdquo; No engagement-ring is used in this neighbourhood, no
priest (or L&#277;bai) is present at the engagement ceremony, nor is
the girl asked for her consent. On the other hand, a regular system of
exchanging presents, after the engagement, is said to have been
formerly in vogue in Selangor, the man sending betel-leaf, fruit, and
eggs to his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> from time to time in net-work
receptacles, and the woman sending specially prepared rice, etc. in
rush-work receptacles of various patterns. It is said, too, that the
woman would occasionally carve a chain, consisting of three or four
links, out of a single areca-nut, in which case the prospective
bridegroom was supposed to redeem it by the payment of as many dollars
as there were links. The betel-nut presented on these occasions
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>would be wrapped up in a gradation of three
beautifully worked cloths, not unlike &ldquo;D&rsquo;oyleys&rdquo; in
general appearance, whilst the actual engagement ceremony in former
days is said to have received additional interest and formality from
the recital of verses appropriate to the occasion by chosen
representatives of each party. Specimens of the betrothal verses
formerly used in Selangor will be found in the Appendix. The following

preparations for the wedding.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e19985src"
href="#xd21e19985" name="xd21e19985src">75</a></p>
<p class="par">Both houses are decorated with vertically striped
hangings (<i lang="ms">p&rsquo;lang tabir</i>) and ornamental
ceiling-cloths (<i lang="ms">langit-langit</i>), and mats, rugs,
carpets, etc. are laid down. In the bridegroom&rsquo;s house little is
done beyond erecting a small platform or dais (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;t&#259;rana</i>) about six feet square, and raised about
ten inches from the floor, upon which he is to don his wedding garments
when he sets out to meet the bride. A similar platform (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;t&#259;rana</i>) is erected in the bride&rsquo;s house, and
a low dais called <i lang="ms">rambat</i> in front of her door, at the
outer corners of which are fixed two standard candlesticks (<i lang=
"ms">tiang rambat</i>), which are sometimes as much as six feet high,
and each of which carries three candles, one in the centre and one on
each side, those at the side being supported by ornamental brackets
(<i lang="ms">sulor bayong</i>). The <i lang="ms">rambat</i> may
measure some 14 feet in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href=
"#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span>length by 5 feet in width, and
should be about 14 inches in height.</p>
<p class="par">A dais (with two steps to it) is then built as follows,
generally opposite the doorway, but standing a little way back from it,
and facing the <i lang="ms">rambat</i>, so as to leave a narrow passage
(<i lang="ms">tela k&#277;chil</i>) between the threshold and the dais,
which latter is decked with scarlet, or at least scarlet-bordered cloth
(<i lang="ms">kain b&#277;rumpok d&#277;ngan s&#259;kalat</i>). The
lower step of the dais (<i lang="ms">ibu g&rsquo;rei</i>) is raised
about 12 inches from the floor, and measures from 10 feet to 12 feet in
length by 8 feet in width. The upper step (<i lang="ms">g&rsquo;rei
p&#277;napah</i>) is a little smaller, and is only raised about 10
inches above the lower one. The top of the dais is covered with a
mattress, and both steps are decorated with expensive borders, which at
the wedding of a Raja are made of embossed gold or silver, and may
easily cost as much as $150 each, or even more. The mattress is covered
in its turn with a quilt (<i lang="ms">lihap</i> or <i lang=
"ms">p&#277;lampap</i>), made of coloured silk stuffed with cotton;
upon this quilt is laid a white cotton sheet, and the whole is
surmounted by a row of colossal &ldquo;pillows&rdquo; (of the size of
small packing-cases), surmounted by others of moderate size.</p>
<p class="par">A mosquito-curtain is hung over all, and the completed
couch is called <i lang="ms">p&#277;lamin</i>. The head of the <i lang=
"ms">p&#277;lamin</i>, it must be added, where the pillows are piled,
is always on the left-hand side as you look towards it.</p>
<p class="par">The number of the pillows used is of the highest
importance, as indicating the rank of the contracting parties. The
larger ones are about 5 feet in length and 2 feet in height by
1&frac12; feet in width. They are covered with rich embroidery at the
exposed end, and are arranged in a horizontal row (<i lang=
"ms">sa-tunda</i>), with their sides just touching, in the front
left-hand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>corner of the mosquito-curtain, so as to leave a
clear passage of about 3 feet behind them (at the back of the curtain)
by which the bride and bridegroom may escape to the <i lang=
"ms">p&#277;raduan</i> after the ceremony. These big pillows are white,
with the exception of the embroidered ends, unless they are intended
for a Raja, when the royal colour (yellow) is of course substituted.
The one nearest the centre of the couch is called <i lang="ms">bantal
tumpu</i>, and usually has a hexagonal or (in the case of a Raja)
octagonal bolster deposited beside it.</p>
<p class="par">The smaller pillows are red (occasionally purple,
<i lang="ms">ungu</i>, or orange, <i lang="ms">jingga</i>), and are
called the &ldquo;embroidered pillows&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">bantal
b&#277;rt&#277;kat</i>, or <i lang="ms">bantal p&rsquo;rada</i>).
Occasionally a set of twelve small pillows is used (when they are
called <i lang="ms">bantal dua-b&rsquo;las</i>, or the Twelve Pillows),
but often there is only one of them to each &ldquo;Big Pillow,&rdquo;
the set of twelve being said to be an innovation, probably introduced
from Malacca. Sometimes, however, when many small pillows are piled
upon each other, measures have to be taken to keep them from falling,
in which case the space between the piles is said to be filled up with
wool or cotton stuffing (<i lang="ms">p&#277;ny&#277;lat</i>), the
front being covered with embroidered cloth, the upper border of which
is carried up diagonally from the top of one pile to the top of the
next.</p>
<p class="par">As regards the permissible number of big pillows,
according to a scale in use at Klang, the common people are allowed
three big pillows (including the <i lang="ms">bantal tumpu</i>); a
wealthy man, four; and a Headman, such as the &rsquo;Toh Kaya
K&#277;chil, five; a Raja being presumably allowed one or two more.
According to this scale it is only the big pillows that are of
importance,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20135src" href="#xd21e20135"
name="xd21e20135src">76</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href=
"#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>and the people are allowed to use
as few or as many small ones as they like. The topmost small pillow,
however, is always triangular, and is called <i lang=
"ms">gunong-gunongan</i>.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The mosquito-curtain (enclosing the couch on which the
pillows rest) of course varies in size according to the dimensions of
the <i lang="ms">p&#277;lamin</i>, but may be roughly taken to be from
7 to 9 <i lang="ms">hasta</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e20166src"
href="#xd21e20166" name="xd21e20166src">77</a> in length, by 8 ft. in
width, and 4 ft. to 5 ft. in height (reaching to the ceiling-cloth).
Its upper edges (<i lang="ms">kansor</i>) are stiffened externally with
a square frame, consisting of four bamboo rods (<i lang="ms">galah
k&rsquo;lambu</i>), and it is decorated in front with a beautifully
embroidered fringe called &ldquo;Bo-tree leaves&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">daun budi</i>). The front of this mosquito-curtain is rolled
up<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20182src" href="#xd21e20182" name=
"xd21e20182src">78</a> to within 2 or 3 ft. of the top, instead of
being drawn aside as usual. At the back of the curtain is suspended,
except in the case of a Raja&rsquo;s wedding, a bamboo clothes-rod
(<i lang="ms">buluh sangkutkan kain</i>). This rod terminates at each
extremity in an ornamental piece of scroll-work (<i lang="ms">sulor
bayong</i>) covered with scarlet cloth, which is sometimes made to
issue from a short stem of horn or ivory, and has a wooden collar
called <i lang="ms">dulang-dulang</i>. This <i lang=
"ms">dulang-dulang</i>, moreover, is sometimes provided with small
hollows (<i lang="ms">&rsquo;mbat-&rsquo;mbat</i>) at the top, two in
front which are filled with rose-water or perfume (<i lang="ms">ayer
mawar</i> or <i lang="ms">ayer wangi</i>), and two at the back which
are filled with flowers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href=

<p class="par">Above the clothes-rod, and between its suspending cords
(<i lang="ms">tali p&#277;nggantong</i>)&mdash;which, by the way, are
also covered with scarlet cloth&mdash;an inner fringe of
&ldquo;Bo-leaves&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">daun budi dalam</i>) is sometimes
added at the top of the curtain.</p>
<p class="par">At the wedding of a Raja nothing else should be put
inside the curtain, but at an ordinary wedding a few small articles of
typical marriage furniture are usually added as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Three or four small clothes boxes (<i lang=
"ms">saharah</i>), such as are kept by every Malay family, and <i lang=
"ms">p&#277;ti kapor</i> (boxes whose corners are strengthened and
decorated with brass) are ranged upon the mattress just below the
clothes-rod. Upon these should be placed (<i>a</i>) the <i lang=
"ms">bangking</i>, which is a kind of jar or urn of lacquered wood,
ranging from about half a foot to a foot in height, and contains a
portion of the bride&rsquo;s wardrobe; and (<i>b</i>) the <i lang=
"ms">bun</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20243src" href="#xd21e20243"
name="xd21e20243src">79</a> which is either octagonal (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;chah d&rsquo;lapan</i>), or hexagonal (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;chah anam</i>), as the case may be, and which may be
described as a box of tin, or sometimes of lacquered wood, whose
contents are as follows:&mdash;(1) a couple of combs (<i lang=
"ms">sikat dua bilah</i>), one with large and one with small teeth; (2)
a small cup or saucer of hair oil (a preparation of cocoa-nut oil), or
attar of roses (<i lang="ms">minyak attar</i>), or pomatum (<i lang=
"ms">kateneh</i>); (3) a small pen-knife for paring the nails; (4) a
pair of scissors; (5) a preparation of antimony (<i lang=
"ms">ch&#277;lak</i>), which is a sort of black ointment applied by the
Malays to the inside edge of the eyelids; and (6) a Malay work-box
(called <i lang="ms">dulang</i> in Selangor and <i lang=
"ms">bintang</i> at Malacca), which is a circular box of painted or
lacquered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>wood, furnished with a lid, and containing
needles, cotton, and the rest of the Malay housewife&rsquo;s
paraphernalia.</p>
<p class="par">Near the door of the curtain is placed an earthenware
water-jar, called <i lang="ms">g&#277;lok</i> (<i lang="ms">g&#277;lok
K&#277;dah</i> and <i lang="ms">g&#277;lok Perak</i> are the usual
&ldquo;makes&rdquo;); this jar stands upon a small brass or earthenware
plate with high sides (<i lang="ms">bokor</i>), and its mouth is
covered with a brass or earthenware saucer (<i lang="ms">chepir</i>),
on which is laid the brass or earthenware bowl (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;nchedok ayer</i> or <i lang="ms">batil</i>) which is used
for scooping up water from the water-jar, and which, when it is in use,
is temporarily replaced by an ornamental cap woven from strips of
screw-palm leaves. A couple of candlesticks placed near the water-jar,
a betel tray (<i lang="ms">tepah</i> or <i lang="ms">puan</i>), a basin
(<i lang="ms">batil b&#277;sar</i>) for washing off the lees of henna,
and a &ldquo;cuspadore&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">k&#277;tor</i>), all of
which are placed inside the curtain, complete the preparations for this
portion of the ceremony.</p>
<p class="par">The day concludes, as far as the workers are concerned,
with a meal in which all who have assisted in the preparations take
part, and this is followed by various diversions dear to Malays, such
as the chanting of passages from the Kor&#257;n.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">At a royal wedding, either the &ldquo;Story of <i lang=
"ms">&rsquo;Che M&#277;gat</i>&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">&rsquo;Che
M&#277;gat Mantri</i>), or a royal cock-fight (<i lang="ms">main
d&#277;nok</i>), or a performance by dancing girls or fencers (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;dikir</i>), may be substituted for these more devotional
exercises.</p>
<p class="par">These performances (whatever they may be) are kept up
(with intervals for rest and refreshment) till four or five in the
morning, when the guests disperse <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375"

sleep off the night&rsquo;s fatigue.</p>
<p class="par">Whilst the games are progressing (at about nine or ten
<span class="sc">P.M.</span>) the first staining of the finger-nails of
the bride and bridegroom is commenced, the ceremony on this occasion
being conducted in the seclusion of the inner apartments, and hence
called the &ldquo;Stolen Henna-staining&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">b&#277;rhinei churi</i>). Leaves of henna are taken and pounded
together with a small piece of charcoal, and the &ldquo;mash&rdquo; is
applied to the finger-nails of both hands (with the exception of the
middle or &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s finger,&rdquo; <i lang="ms">jari
hantu</i>). The centre of each palm is also touched with the dye, the
area stained being as much as would be covered by a dollar. A line (of
a finger&rsquo;s breadth) is also said to be drawn along the inner side
of the sole of each foot, from the great toe to the heel (<i lang=

<p class="par">When the last has arrived (at about seven <span class=

the bride at her house and bridegroom at his respectively make their
first appearance in public, clad in their wedding garments, for the
ceremony of staining the finger-nails, this time in public. When they
are seated (between the two candlesticks, which are lighted to
facilitate the operation) a tray is brought forward, furnished with the
usual accessories of Malay magic, rice-paste (<i lang="ms">t&#277;pong
tawar</i>), washed rice, &ldquo;saffron&rdquo; rice, and parched rice,
to which is added, in this instance, a sort of pudding of the pounded
henna-leaves. A censer is next produced, and a brass tray with a foot
to it (called <i lang="ms">s&#277;mb&rsquo;rip</i>) is loaded with
<i lang="ms">nasi b&#277;rhinei</i> (<i lang="ms">pulut</i> or
&ldquo;glutinous&rdquo; rice stained with saffron), in which are
planted some ten to fifteen purple eggs (dyed with a mixture of brazil
wood (<i lang="ms">s&#277;pang</i>) and lime, and stuck upon ornamental
sprays of bamboo decorated with coloured paper). The bride (or
bridegroom) is then seated in a &ldquo;begging&rdquo; attitude, with
the hands resting upon a cushion placed in the lap; the first of the
guests then takes a pinch of incense from the tray and burns it in the
brazier (<i lang="ms">t&#277;mpat bara</i>); next he takes a pinch of
parched rice, a pinch of newly-washed rice, and a pinch of saffron
rice, and, squeezing them together in the right fist, fumigates them by
holding them for a moment over the burning incense, and then throws
them towards the sitter, first towards the right, then towards the
left, and finally into the sitter&rsquo;s lap.</p>

<p class="par">A pinch of the henna is then taken and dabbed upon the

enable this to be done.</p>
<p class="par">The sitter then salutes the guest by raising his (or
her) hands with the palms together before the breast in an attitude of
prayer; the guest replies by a similar action, and the ceremony is at

the aforesaid coloured eggs. Into a hole at the top of the mast is
fitted the end of a short rattan or cane, which is split into four
branches, each of which again is split into three twigs, whilst on the
end of each twig is stuck one of the coloured eggs (<i lang=

<p class="par">The <i lang="ms">s&#277;takona</i> is erected in front
of the <i lang="ms">p&#277;lamin</i>, on which the bride takes her seat
at about 4 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> to await the coming of the
bridegroom, the members of her own bridal party, including the

<i lang="ms">zikir maulud</i> in the reception room at frequent
intervals from 9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> until the
bridegroom&rsquo;s arrival. The arrangements are completed by placing
ready for the bridegroom the &ldquo;Bridal Mat&rdquo; (<i lang=

in the case of a Raja, a small quilt, embroidered in the manner called
<i lang="ms">jong sarat</i>) five cubits of white cloth, which are
rolled up and put on one side, and a tray of betel.</p>
<p class="par">Returning to the bridegroom, holy water (<i lang=

bridegroom to wash his face and hands, and he then proceeds to put on
his wedding garments, as described above, after which a scarf (<i lang=

procession (<i lang="ms">p&#277;rarakan</i>) then sets out, the women
heading it (<i lang="ms">p&#277;nganjor</i>) and the men following, the

exhibitions of Malay fencing (<i lang="ms">main silat</i>) and dancing,
etc., to the accompaniment of the <i lang="ms">zikir</i> intoned by
their companions.</p>
<p class="par">The arrival of the bridegroom at the bride&rsquo;s house
is the signal for a mimic conflict for the person of the bride, which
is called <i lang="ms">m&#277;lawa</i>, and is strangely reminiscent of
similar customs which formerly obtained in Europe.</p>

<p class="par">In some cases a rope or piece of red cloth would be
stretched across the path to bar the progress of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
party, and a stout enough resistance would be offered by the defenders
until the bridegroom consented to pay a fine which formerly amounted,
it is said, to as much as $20, though not more than $3 or $4 would now
be asked. Occasionally the bridegroom would pay the fine by pulling the
ring off his finger and handing it to the bride&rsquo;s relations, but
the ceremony would not unfrequently end in a free fight. Verses were
recited on these occasions, of which a few stanzas will be found in the

liveliest tune, and as the bridegroom is carried up the steps he has to
force his way through an Amazonian force consisting of the ladies of
the bride&rsquo;s party, who assemble to repel the invader from the
threshold. A well-directed fire is maintained by others, who pour upon
the foe over the heads of the defenders <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">Meanwhile the bridegroom persists until his efforts are
crowned with success, and he makes his way (assisted possibly by some
well-meant act of treachery on the part of the garrison) to the
reception room, when the mat already referred to is unrolled and the
white cloth suspended over it. Here the bridegroom takes his seat and
the priest comes out to perform the wedding ceremony.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e20837src" href="#xd21e20837" name="xd21e20837src">89</a> This,
strangely enough, is performed with the bridegroom alone, the priest
saying to him in the presence of three or four witnesses and his surety
(<i lang="ms">wali</i>), generally his father, &ldquo;I wed you, A., to
B., daughter of C., for a portion of two <i lang=
"ms">bharas</i>.&rdquo; To this the bridegroom has to respond without
allowing an interval, &ldquo;I accept this marriage with B., for a
portion of two <i lang="ms">bharas</i>&rdquo; (or one <i lang=
"ms">bhara</i> if one of the parties has been married before). Even
this short sentence, however, is a great deal too much for the nerves
of some Malay bridegrooms, who have been known to spend a couple of
hours in abortive attempts before they could get the Im&#257;m to
&ldquo;pass&rdquo; it. As soon, however, as this obstacle has been
surmounted, the priest asks those present if they will bear witness to
its correctness, and on their replying in the affirmative, it is
followed by the &ldquo;<i lang="ms">bacha salawat</i>,&rdquo; which
consists of repeated shouts from the company <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>of
&ldquo;Peace be with thee.&rdquo; This part of the ceremony completed,
one of the brothers or near relations of the bridegroom leads him into
the bridal chamber, and seats him in the usual cross-legged position on
the left side of the bride, who sits with her feet tucked up on his
right. Even the process of seating the couple (<i lang=
"ms">b&#277;rsanding</i>) is a very fatiguing one; each of them has to
bend the knees slowly until a sitting posture is reached, and then
return to a standing posture by slowly straightening the knees, a
gymnastic exercise which has to be repeated thrice, and which requires
the assistance of friends.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20880src" href=
"#xd21e20880" name="xd21e20880src">90</a></p>
<p class="par">The seating having been accomplished, friends put in the
right hands of bride and bridegroom respectively handfuls of rice taken
from the <i lang="ms">nasi s&#277;takona;</i> with this the two feed
each other simultaneously, each of them reaching out the hand
containing the rice to the other&rsquo;s mouth. (This part of the
ceremony is often made the occasion for a race.)</p>
<p class="par">The bridegroom is then carried off by his friends to the
outer chamber, where he has to pay his respects (<i lang=
"ms">minta&rsquo; ma&#703;af</i>, lit. &ldquo;ask pardon&rdquo;) to the
company, after which he is carried back to his old post, the bride in
the meantime having moved off a little in the mosquito curtain.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=

<p class="par">The sweetmeats are then brought and handed round, the
<i lang="ms">s&#277;takona</i> is broken up, and the bundles of rice
wrapped in plantain leaves which it contains distributed to the company
as largess or <i lang="ms">b&#277;rkat</i>. Each of the company gets
one of the <i lang="ms">t&#277;lor chachak</i>, the <i lang=

<p class="par">This completes the wedding ceremony, but the bridegroom
is nominally expected to remain under the roof (and eye) of his
mother-in-law for about two years (reduced to forty-four days in the
case of &ldquo;royalty&rdquo;), after which he may be allowed to remove
to a house of his own. No Kathi<a class="noteref" id="xd21e20936src"
href="#xd21e20936" name="xd21e20936src">92</a> was present until quite
recently at marriages in Selangor, nor has it in the past been the
practice, so far as I could find out, for him to attend. Sir S. Raffles
gives as part of the formula used in Java:&mdash;&ldquo;If you travel
at sea for a year, or ashore for six months, without sending either
money or message to your wife, she will complain to the judge and
obtain one <i lang="ms">talak</i> (the preliminary stage of
divorce),&rdquo; and this condition should, strictly speaking, be
included in the Malay formula. It is now growing obsolete, but was in
former days repeated first by the priest, and then by the bridegroom
after him. The marriage portion (<i lang="ms">isi kahwin</i>, Arabic
<i lang="ms">mahar</i>) is here generally called <i lang=
"ms">b&rsquo;lanja kahwin</i> or <i lang="ms">mas kahwin</i>.<a class=

<p class="par">For three days lustrations are continued by the
newly-married pair, but before they are completed, and as soon as
possible after the wedding, friends and acquaintances once more put on
their finery, and proceed to the house to pay their respects, to bathe,
and to receive largess.</p>
<p class="par">On the third day after the <i lang="ms">hari
langsong</i> there is a very curious ceremony called <i lang="ms">mandi
tolak bala</i>, or <i lang="ms">mandi ayer salamat</i> (bathing for
good luck).</p>
<p class="par">On the night in question the relatives of the bridegroom
assemble under cover of the darkness and make a bonfire under the house
of the newly-married couple by collecting and burning rubbish; into the
fire thus kindled they throw cocoa-nut husks and pepper, or anything
likely to make it unpleasant for those within, and presently raise such
a smoke that the bridegroom comes hastily down the steps, ostensibly to
see what is the matter, but as soon as he makes his appearance, he is
seized by his relatives and carried off bodily to his own
parents&rsquo; house; these proceedings being known as the stealing of
the bridegroom (<i lang="ms">churi p&#277;ngantin</i>). Next day there
is a grand procession to escort him back to the house of his bride,
which he reaches about one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, the
processionists carrying &ldquo;Rice of the Presence&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">nasi adap-adap</i>) with the eggs stuck into it as on the last day
of the wedding, two sorts of holy water in pitchers, called
respectively <i lang="ms">ayer salamat</i> (water of good luck), and
<i lang="ms">ayer tolak bala</i> (water to avert ill-luck), vases of
flowers (<i lang="ms">gumba</i>) containing blossom-spikes of the
cocoa-nut and areca-nut palms, and young cocoa-nut leaves rudely
plaited into the semblance of spikes of palm-blossom, k&rsquo;risses,
etc. etc., together with a large number of rude syringes manufactured
from joints of bamboo, and called <i lang="ms">panah ayer</i>, or
&ldquo;water-bows.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href=
"#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A set of similar objects (including <i lang="ms">nasi
adap-adap</i>), is prepared by the relatives of the bride, and
deposited upon the ground in the place selected for the bathing
ceremony. A bench being added for the bride and bridegroom to sit upon,
the ceremony commences with the customary rite of <i lang=
"ms">t&#277;pong tawar</i>, after which the two kinds of holy water,
<i lang="ms">ayer tolak bala</i> and <i lang="ms">ayer salamat</i>, are
successively thrown over the pair.</p>
<p class="par">Now, according to the proper custom, during the
proceedings which follow, all the bride&rsquo;s relatives should
surround the bride&rsquo;s seat, and the bridegroom&rsquo;s relatives
should stand at a distance; but, in order to save themselves from a
wetting, the women of both parties now usually assemble round the bride
and bridegroom, where they are protected by a sheet which is hung
between them and the men; for all the young men now proceed to
discharge their &ldquo;water arrows,&rdquo; and as they are stopped by
the sheet they proceed to turn their syringes against each other, until
all are thoroughly wetted.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile a young cocoa-nut frond, twisted into a
slip-knot with V-shaped ends (something like the &ldquo;merry
thought&rdquo; of a fowl), is presented to the bride and bridegroom,
each of whom takes hold of one end, and blowing on it (<i lang=
"ms">s&#277;mbor</i>) thrice, pulls it till it comes undone, and the
<i lang="ms">l&#277;pas-l&#277;pas</i> rite is concluded. Finally, a
girdle of thread is passed seven times over the heads and under the
feet of the bride and bridegroom, when the bridegroom breaks through
the thread and they are all free to return homewards. This latter
ceremony is called <i lang="ms">&rsquo;lat-&rsquo;lat</i>. The guests
then return to their homes, divest themselves of their wet garments,
and put on their wedding attire. The <i lang=
"ms">b&#277;rsuap-suapan</i>, or feeding ceremony, is then performed
(both vessels <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>of <i lang="ms">adap-adap</i> rice being used),
and then all parties disperse for the usual games. Seven days after the
&ldquo;Concluding Day&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">Hari Langsong</i>), the
ceremony of Discarding the Earrings (<i>i.e.</i> <i lang=
"ms">subang</i>, the emblems of virginity) is performed by the
bride.</p>
<p class="par">Raja B&ocirc;t of Selangor, who attaches great
importance to the lustration ceremony, and says that it ought not to
take place later than the seventh day (at a Raja&rsquo;s wedding), thus
describes the full ceremony as once arranged by himself:&mdash;A small
bath-house was built at the top of a flight of seven steps, and water
was pumped up to it through a pipe, whose upper end was made fast under
the roof of the shed, and terminated in the head of a dragon (<i lang=
"ms">naga</i>), from whose jaws the water spouted. The steps were
completely lined with women, of whom there must have been an immense
number (no men being allowed to be present), and the Raja and his bride
bathed before them. A royal bath-house of this kind is called <i lang=
"ms">balei pancha p&#277;rsada</i>, and should be used not only at
&ldquo;royal&rdquo; weddings, but at coronations (<i lang="ms">waktu
di-naubatkan</i>); it is described in the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e21057">

it may be remarked as some sort of a practical conclusion to this
account, that the Malay wedding ceremony, even as carried out by the
poorer classes, shows that the contracting parties are treated as
royalty, that is to say, as sacred human beings, and if any further
proof is required, in addition to the evidence which may be drawn from
the general character of the ceremony, I may mention, firstly, the fact
that the bride and bridegroom are actually called <i lang="ms">Raja
Sari</i>, (i.e. <i lang="ms">Raja sa-hari</i>, the &ldquo;sovereigns of
a day&rdquo;); and, secondly, that it is a polite fiction that no
command of theirs, during their one day of sovereignty, may be
disobeyed.</p>

seated a groom&rsquo;sman shading him with a fan, and behind, holding
an umbrella over him, was another. And thus, with many followers
beating drums and singing, and with the Royal <i lang=

taken through the streets in procession. On arriving at the

then conveyed by the elders to the raised dais on which the bride and
bridegroom awaited their friends.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The bridegroom being seated, fourteen of the

others, who were clever at this, followed their example. While this was
going on there was much beating of gongs and drums, and then the same

<p class="par">The marriage customs hitherto described have been only
such as are based on a peaceful understanding between the parents of
the contracting parties. An account of Malay marriage customs would
not, however, be complete without some mention of the customs which
regulate, strange as it may seem, even the forcible abduction of a
wife. Of these customs Sir W. E. Maxwell says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The word <i lang="ms">panjat</i> in Malay means
literally &lsquo;to climb,&rsquo; but it is used in P&ecirc;rak, and
perhaps in other Malay States, to signify a forcible entry into a house
for the purpose of securing as a wife a woman whom her relations have
already refused to the intruder. This high-handed proceeding is
recognised by Malay custom, and is regulated by certain well-known
rules.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="ms">Panjat</i> is of two
kinds&mdash;<i lang="ms">panjat angkara</i> and <i lang="ms">panjat
&rsquo;adat</i>&mdash;entry by violence and entry by custom. In the
first case, the man makes his way into the house armed with his
<i lang="ms">kris</i>, or other weapon, and entering the women&rsquo;s
apartment, or posting himself at the door, secures the person of his
intended bride, or prevents her escape. He runs the risk of being
killed on the spot by the girl&rsquo;s relations, and his safety
depends <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>upon his reputation for courage and strength,
and upon the number of his friends and the influence of his family. A
wooer who adopts this violent method of compelling the assent of
unwilling relations to his marriage to one of their kin must, say the
Malays, have three qualifications&mdash;</p>
<div lang="ms" class="lgouter xd21e2709">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ka-rapat-an baniak,</p>
<p class="line">Wang-nia ber-lebih,</p>
<p class="line">Jantan-nia ber-lebih,</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">&lsquo;A strong party to back him, plenty of
money, and no lack of bravery.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Plenty of money is necessary, because, by
accepted custom, if the relations yield and give their consent all the
customary payments are doubled; the fine for the trespass, which would
ordinarily be twenty-five dollars, becomes fifty dollars; the dower is
likewise doubled, and the usual present of clothes (<i lang=
"ms">salin</i>) must consist of two of each of the three garments
(<i lang="ms">salendang</i>, <i lang="ms">baju</i>, <i lang=
"ms">kain</i>), instead of one as usual. The fine for <i lang=
"ms">panjat angkara</i> may be of any amount, according to the pleasure
of the woman&rsquo;s relations, and they fix it high or low according
to the man&rsquo;s position. I have heard of one case in P&ecirc;rak,
where the fine was five hundred dollars, and another in which the
suitor, to obtain his bride, had to pay one thousand seven hundred and
fifty dollars, namely, one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars as a
fine, and five hundred dollars for the marriage expenses. But in this
case the girl was already betrothed to another, and one thousand
dollars out of the fine went to the disappointed rival.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sometimes the relations hold out, or the man, for
want of one of the three qualifications mentioned above, has to beat an
ignominious retreat. In the reign of Sultan Ali, one Mat Taib, a
<i lang="ms">budak raja</i>, or personal <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb396" href="#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span>attendant on the
Sultan, asked for Wan D&ecirc;na, the daughter of the Bandahara of
Kedah (she then being at Kota Lama in P&ecirc;rak) in marriage. Being
refused he forced his way into the house, and seizing the girl by her
long hair drew his <i lang="ms">kris</i>, and defied everybody. No one
dared to interfere by force, for the man, if attacked, would have
driven his <i lang="ms">kris</i> into the girl&rsquo;s body. This state
of things is said to have lasted three days and three nights, during
which the man neither ate nor slept. Eventually he was drugged by an
old woman from whom he accepted some food or water, and when he fell
asleep the girl was released from his grasp and taken to the
Sultan&rsquo;s palace, where she was married off straightway to one Mat
Arshad. Mat Taib had his revenge, for within a year he <i>amoked</i> at
Bandar, where Mat Arshad lived, killing the latter and wounding Wan
D&ecirc;na.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="ms">Panjat &rsquo;adat</i> is a less
lawless proceeding. A man who is in love with a girl, the consent of
whose parents or relations he cannot obtain, sends his <i lang=
"ms">kris</i> to their house with a message to the effect that he is
ready with the dower, presents, etc., doubled according to custom, and
that he is ready to make good any demands they may make.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">kris</i> is symbolical of the
violent entry, which in this case is dispensed with. If the
girl&rsquo;s guardians are still obdurate they send back the <i lang=
"ms">kris</i>, but with it they must send double the amount of the
dower offered by the man.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21330src" href=

<p class="par first">When a man dies, the corpse (called <i lang=
"ms">Maiat</i>, except in the case of a Raja, when it is called
<i lang="ms">J&#277;naja</i> or <i lang="ms">J&#277;nazah</i>) is laid
on its back, and composed with the feet towards Mecca, and the hands
crossed (the right wrist resting upon the left just below the
breast-bone, and the right fore-finger on the top of the left arm). It
is next shrouded from head to foot in fine new <i>sarongs</i>, one of
which usually covers the body from the feet upwards to the waist, the
other covering it from the waist to the head. There are generally (in
the case of the peasantry) three or four thicknesses of these
<i>sarongs</i>, but when a rich man (<i lang="ms">orang kaya</i>) dies,
as many as seven may be used, each of the seven being made in one long
piece, so as to cover the body from the head to the feet, the cloth
being of fine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name=
"pb398">398</a>]</span>texture, of no recognised colour, but richly
interwoven with gold thread, while the body is laid upon a mattress,
which in turn rests upon a new mat of <i lang="ms">pandanus</i> leaf;
finally, all but the very poorest display the hangings used on great
occasions. At the head of the corpse are then piled five or six new
pillows, with two more on the right and left side of the body resting
against the ribs, while just below the folded hands are laid a pair of
betel-nut scissors (<i lang="ms">kachip b&#277;si</i>), and on the
matting at either side a bowl for burning incense is placed. Some say
that the origin of laying the betel-nut scissors on the breast is that
once upon a time a cat brushed against the body of a dead person,
thereby causing the evil influence (<i lang="ms">badi</i>) which
resides in cats to enter the body, so that it rose and stood upon its
feet. The &ldquo;contact with iron&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21403src" href="#xd21e21403" name="xd21e21403src">104</a>
prevents the dead body from rising again should it happen by any
mischance that a cat (which is generally the only animal kept in the
house, and which should be driven out of the house before the funeral
ceremonies commence) should enter unawares and brush against it. From
this moment until the body is laid in the grave the &ldquo;wake&rdquo;
must be religiously observed, and the body be watched both by day and
night to see that nothing which is forbidden (<i lang="ms">pantang</i>)
may come near it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21413src" href=
"#xd21e21413" name="xd21e21413src">105</a> <span class=

Im&#257;m, Bilal, or Khatib, or in their absence the Pah Doja, or Pah
L&#277;bai, is then summoned, and early notice of the funeral is given
to all relations and friends to give them an opportunity of attending.
Meanwhile the preparations are going on at the house of the deceased.
The shroud (<i lang="ms">kain kapan</i>) and plank or planks for the
coffin are got ready: of coffins there are three kinds, the <i lang=
"ms">papan sak&#277;ping</i> (the simplest form, generally consisting
of a simple plank of <i lang="ms">pulai</i> or <i lang=
"ms">j&#277;lutong</i> wood about six feet long by three spans wide),
the <i lang="ms">karanda</i> (a plain, oblong plank box, of the same
dimensions), and the <i lang="ms">long</i> (consisting either of two
planks which form a sort of gable with closed ends called <i lang=
"ms">kajang rungkop</i>, or the <i lang="ms">long b&#277;tul</i>, which
is like three sides of a box with its sides bulging out, both ends
open, and no bottom). Varnish or paint is forbidden in Malay coffins,
but the planks are washed to insure their cleanliness, and lined with
white cloth (<i lang="ms">alas puteh</i>). About three inches of earth
is put into the <i lang="ms">karanda</i> ordinarily, but if the coffin
is to be kept, about a span&rsquo;s depth of earth, quicklime, and
several katis<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21467src" href="#xd21e21467"
name="xd21e21467src">106</a> of tea-leaves, rush-piths (<i lang=
"ms">sumbu kumpai</i>), and camphor are also deposited in it, in
successive layers, the rush-piths at the top. Afterwards when the
corpse has been laid on the top, tea-leaves are put at front and back
of the corpse as it lies.</p>
<p class="par">The next operation is to wash the corpse, which is
carried for this purpose into the front or outer room. If there are
four people to be found who are willing to undertake this disagreeable
duty, they are told to sit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href=
"#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>upon the floor in a row, all
looking the same way, and with their legs stretched out (<i lang=
"ms">b&#277;lunjor kaki</i>), the body being then laid across their
laps (<i lang="ms">riba</i>). Several men are then told off to fetch
water in jars, scoop it out of the jars and pour it on the body in
small quantities by means of the &ldquo;scoop&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">p&#277;nch&#277;dok ayer</i>), which is usually a small bowl,
saucer, or cocoa-nut shell (<i lang="ms">t&#277;mpurong</i>). It
frequently happens, however, that this unpleasant task finds no
volunteers, in which case five banana stems are turned into improvised
&ldquo;rollers&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">galang</i>), on which the body is
raised from the floor during the process of washing (<i lang=
"ms">m&#277;ruang</i>). When the body is ready for washing, a chief
washer (<i lang="ms">orang m&#277;ruang</i>) is engaged for a fee of
about a dollar; this is usually the Bilal or Im&#257;m, who
&ldquo;shampoos&rdquo; the body whilst the rest are pouring water on
it. The body then undergoes a second washing, this time with the
cosmetic called <i lang="ms">ayer b&#277;dak</i> which is prepared by
taking a handful of rice (<i lang="ms">sa-g&#277;nggam
b&rsquo;ras</i>), two or three &ldquo;dips&rdquo; of lime (<i lang=
"ms">cholek kapur</i>),and a pinch of gambier (<i lang="ms">gambir
sa-chubit</i>)&mdash;the last three being the usual concomitants of a
single &ldquo;chew&rdquo; of the betel-leaf&mdash;and pounding them up
together with the rice. When pounded they are mixed with water
(<i lang="ms">di-banchor</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e21517src" href=
"#xd21e21517" name="xd21e21517src">107</a>) in a large bowl holding
about two gallons, the water at the top being poured off into a vessel
of similar capacity, and scooped up and sprinkled as before on the
corpse. The next washing is with juice of limes. Four or five limes
(<i lang="ms">limau nipis</i>) are taken, the ends cut off, and each
lime slashed crosswise on the top without completely severing the
parts. These limes are then squeezed (<i lang="ms">di-ramaskan</i>)
into another large bowl containing water, and the washing repeated. The
final washing, or &ldquo;Nine Waters&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">ayer sambilan</i>, so called from
the water being scooped up, and poured thrice to the right, thrice to
the left, and thrice over the front of the corpse from head to foot) is
performed with fresh water as at first, and the whole ceremony when
completed is called <i lang="ms">b&#277;dara</i>. The washing
completed, the orifices&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> ears, nostrils,
eyes&mdash;are generally stopped with cotton, and the body is carried
back to its mattress, and laid in a shroud of white cotton cloth, which
should be about seven feet long by four feet in width (<i lang=
"ms">salabuh</i>), so that the edges meet over the breast. After this
the last kiss is given by the nearest relatives, <i>who must not,
however, disturb the corpse by letting their tears fall upon its
features</i>. The shroud is usually of three thicknesses in the case of
poor people, but wealthier families use five, and even seven-fold
shrouds. In Selangor, however, each shroud is usually a separate piece
of cloth. The dead body of a child is sometimes covered in addition
with a fine sort of white powder (<i lang="ms">abok tanah</i> or
<i lang="ms">tayamam</i>), which is sprinkled over the face and arms.
Five knots are used in fastening the shroud, the ends being drawn up
and tied (<i lang="ms">kochong</i>) <i>by means of the unravelled hem
or selvage of the shroud torn into tape-like strips</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e21563src" href="#xd21e21563" name=
"xd21e21563src">108</a> which are bound thrice round the body at the
breast, the knees, and the hips respectively, as well as above the head
and below the feet. The corpse is then laid on the mattress or mat
again, this time with its head to the north, and on its right side
looking towards the west (Mecca), which is the position it is to occupy
in the grave. Prayers are then offered by four or five
&ldquo;praying-men&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">orang
m&#277;ny&#277;mbahyang</i>), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402"
href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>who know the burial service
by heart, the Bilal or Im&#257;m joining in the service, and all
turning towards the west in the usual way. One
&ldquo;praying-man&rdquo; is sufficient, if no more are to be had, his
fee ranging from 50 cents to a dollar in the case of the poorer
classes, and among the rich often amounting to $5 or $6. This service
is held about 1 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> so as to give plenty of
time to carry the body to the grave and return before nightfall.</p>
<p class="par">A jugful of eagle-wood (<i lang="ms">gharu</i>) and
sandal-wood (<i lang="ms">ch&#277;ndana</i>) water is then prepared, a
small piece of each wood being taken and grated on a stone over the jug
until the water becomes appreciably scented; about twenty leaves of the
sweet-scented pandanus (<i lang="ms">pandan wangi</i>) are then added,
together with a bunch of fragrant areca-palm blossoms, and other
scented flowers, such as the <i lang="ms">champaka</i> and <i lang=
"ms">k&#277;nanga</i>, which are shredded (<i lang="ms">di-iris</i>)
into a wooden tray and mixed together, whilst fragrant essences, such
as rose-water (<i lang="ms">ayer mawar</i>), lavender water (<i lang=

or <i lang="ms">turki</i>) are added when obtainable. A betel-leaf tray

prepared, together with a new mat of pandanus-leaf, in which are rolled
up five <i lang="ms">hasta</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e21617src"
href="#xd21e21617" name="xd21e21617src">109</a> of white cloth, and a
brass bowl or alms box, in which latter are to be placed the
contributions (<i lang="ms">s&#277;d&#277;kah</i>) of the
deceased&rsquo;s relations. The preparations are completed by bringing
in the bier (<i lang="ms">usongan</i>), which has to be made on
purpose, except in towns where a bier is kept in the mosque.</p>
<p class="par">In the case of the single plank coffin the body is laid
on the plank (which is carried on the bier) and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span>a
sort of wicker-work covering (<i lang="ms">lerang-lerang</i>) of split
bamboo is placed over the corpse, so as to protect it on its way to the
grave. In the case of the <i lang="ms">karanda</i> the body is laid in
the coffin, which is carried on the bier; and in the case of the
<i lang="ms">long</i>, there being no bottom in this form of coffin,
the body lies on a mat. In each case the bier is covered with a pall
(<i lang="ms">kain tudong</i>) of as good coloured cloth (<i>never
white</i>, but often green) as may be obtainable. There are generally
two or three of these coverings, and floral decorations are sometimes
thrown across them, the blossoms of the areca-palm and the scented
pandanus being woven into exquisite floral strips, called
&ldquo;Centipedes&rsquo; Feet&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">jari lipan</i>),
about three feet long by two fingers in breadth, and laid at short
intervals across the pall. There are generally from five to six of
these floral strips, the areca blossom alternating with the pandanus.
The number of bearers depends on the rank of the deceased; in the case
of a Sultan as many as possible bear a hand in sending him to the
grave, partly because of the <i lang="ms">pahala</i> or merit thereby
obtained, and partly (no doubt) for the sake of the <i lang=
"ms">s&#277;d&#277;kah</i> or alms given to bearers. The procession
then starts for the grave; none of the mourners or followers here wear
any special dress or sign of mourning, such as the white sash with
coloured ribbon which is sometimes worn at Singapore (unless the
<i lang="ms">kabong puteh</i> or strip of white cloth which is
distributed as a funeral favour at the death of a Sultan may be so
reckoned). The only mourning which appears to be known to Malays is the
rare use of a kind of black edging for the envelopes of letters, and
that is no doubt copied from the English custom, though I may add that
a letter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span>which announces a death should have no <i lang=
"ms">kapala</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21664src" href=
"#xd21e21664" name="xd21e21664src">110</a> Loud wailing and weeping is
forbidden by the Im&#257;m for fear of disturbing the dead. The mosque
drum is not usually beaten for funerals in Selangor, nor is the body
usually carried into the mosque, but is borne straight to the tomb. If
the coffin is a single plank one, on arriving at the grave (which
should have been dug early in the morning) an excavation is made on the
left side of the grave for the reception of the corpse, the cavity
being called <i lang="ms">liang lahad</i>. Three men then lower the
corpse into the grave, where three others are waiting to receive it,
and the corpse is deposited in the cavity on its right side (<i lang=
"ms">m&#277;ngiring ka lambong kanan</i>), looking towards the west
(Mecca), and with the head therefore lying towards the north. Four pegs
(<i lang="ms">daka-daka</i>) are then driven in to keep the plank in a
diagonal position and prevent it from falling on the body, while the
plank in turn protects the corpse from being struck by falling
earth.</p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="ms">karanda</i> is lowered into the centre
of the grave in the same way as a European coffin, the body, however,
being invariably deposited in the position just described; whilst the
<i lang="ms">long</i> acts as a sort of lid to a shallow trench (just
big enough to contain the body) which is dug (<i lang=
"ms">di-k&rsquo;roh</i>) in the middle of the grave-pit. The five bands
swathing the corpse (<i lang="ms">lima tali-p&#277;ngikat maiat</i>)
are then removed, and at this point the bystanders occasionally hand
lumps of earth (<i lang="ms">tanah sa-k&#277;pal</i>) to the men
standing in the pit, who, after putting them to the nostrils of the
deceased &ldquo;to be smelled,&rdquo; deposit them at the side of the
grave, when they are shovelled in by those standing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>at
the top.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21696src" href="#xd21e21696" name=
"xd21e21696src">111</a> The filling of the grave then proceeds, but as
it is &ldquo;taboo&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">pantang</i>) to let the earth
strike against the coffin in its fall, the grave-diggers, who are still
standing in the pit, receive it as it falls upon a sort of small hurdle
or screen made of branches, and thence tilt it into the grave. As the
grave (which is usually dug to about the level of a man&rsquo;s ear)
fills up, the grave-diggers, who are forbidden to shovel in the soil
themselves, tread down the earth and level it, and they are not allowed
to leave the pit till it is filled up to the top. One of the relations
then takes a piece of any hard wood, and rudely fashions with a knife a
temporary grave-post (<i lang="ms">nisan</i> or <i lang=
"ms">nishan</i>), which is round in the case of a man and flattened in
the case of a woman; one of these grave-posts is placed exactly over
the head (<i lang="ms">rantau kapala</i>) and the other over the waist
(<i lang="ms">rantau pinggang</i>), not at the feet as in the case of
Europeans. Thus the two grave-posts are ordinarily about three feet
apart, but tradition says that over the grave of a <i lang=
"ms">kramat</i> or saint, they will always be found some five or six
feet at least apart, one at the head and one at the feet, <i>and it is
said to be the saint himself who moves them</i>. To the knob of the
grave-post is tied a strip of white cloth as a sign of recent
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21724src" href="#xd21e21724" name=
"xd21e21724src">112</a></p>
<p class="par">Leaves are then strewn on the ground at the left of the
grave, and the five cubits of white cloth alluded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name="pb406">406</a>]</span>to
above are spread out to form a mat, upon which the Im&#257;m takes his
seat, the rest of the company being seated upon the leaves. Eagle-wood
and sandal-wood water (<i lang="ms">ayer gharu ch&#277;ndana</i>) is
then brought to the Im&#257;m, who pours it out in three libations,
each time sprinkling the grave from the head to the foot. If any water
is left, the Im&#257;m sprinkles it upon any other graves which may be
near, whilst the shredded flowers (<i lang="ms">bunga rampai</i>) are
then similarly disposed of. Next is read the <i lang="ms">talkin</i>,
which is an exhortation (<i lang="ms">ajaran</i>) addressed to the
deceased. <i>It is said</i> that during the process of reading the
Talkin <i>the corpse momentarily revives, and, still lying upon its
side, raises itself to a listening position by reclining upon its right
elbow</i> (b&#277;rt&#277;lku) <i>and resting its head upon its
hand.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e21755src" href="#xd21e21755" name=
"xd21e21755src">113</a> This is the reason<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21764src" href="#xd21e21764" name="xd21e21764src">114</a> for
removing the bands of the shroud, as the body is left free to move, and
thus in groping about</i> (m&#277;raba-raba) <i>with its left hand
feels that its garment is without a hem or selvage, and then first
realising that it must be really dead, composes itself to listen
quietly to whatever the Im&#257;m may say, until at the close of the
exhortation it falls back really lifeless!</i> Hence the most absolute
silence must be observed during the exhortation. The Im&#257;m then
repeats, by way of &ldquo;doxology,&rdquo; the <i lang="ms">tahalil</i>
or <i lang="ms">m&#277;ratib</i>, &ldquo;<i lang=
"ms">la-ilaha-illa-&rsquo;llah</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;there is no god but
God&rdquo;), in company with the rest of the assembly, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name="pb407">407</a>]</span>all
present turning their heads and rocking themselves from side to side as
they sit, whilst they reiterate the words a hundred times, commencing
slowly till thirty-three times are reached, then increasing the pace up
to the sixty-sixth time, and concluding with great rapidity. The
contributions in the alms-basin (<i lang="ms">batil</i>) are then
divided among the entire company as alms (<i lang=
"ms">s&#277;d&#277;kah</i>). The master of the house then invites those
present to partake at about five p.m. of the funeral feast, which in no
way differs from an ordinary Malay banquet, the more solid portion of
the meal (<i lang="ms">makan nasi</i>) being followed by the usual
confectionery and preserved fruits. The Im&#257;m then reads prayers,
and the company breaks up. The decorations for the funeral are left for
three days undisturbed. During these three days the nearer neighbours
are feasted, both in the morning and evening, at the usual Malay hours;
and for three days every night at about ten <span class=
"sc">P.M.</span> the service called &ldquo;Reading the Kor&#257;n to
the Corpse&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">m&#277;ngajikan maiat</i>) is
performed, either by the Im&#257;m or somebody hired for the purpose.
This is an important duty, the slightest slip being regarded as a great
sin. At the end of the three days there is yet another feast, at one
<span class="sc">P.M.</span> (<i lang="ms">kanduri m&#277;niga
hari</i>), when those who are farther off are invited, and after this
meal the <i lang="ms">tahalil</i> is repeated as before.</p>
<p class="par">On the seventh day a similar feast (called <i lang=
"ms">kanduri m&#277;nujoh hari</i>) is followed by the <i lang=
"ms">tahalil</i>, which necessitates a further distribution of fees
(<i lang="ms">s&#277;d&#277;kah tahalil</i>); but in the case of poor
people this second <i lang="ms">tahalil</i> may be omitted, or the
master of the house may say to the company, &ldquo;I ask (to be let
off) the praying fees&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">Sahya minta&rsquo;
s&#277;d&#277;kah tahalil</i>), in which case the <i lang=
"ms">tahalil</i> is free. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href=
"#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Yet another feast is held on the fourteenth day
(<i lang="ms">kanduri dua kali tujoh hari</i>), when the ceremonies are
at end, except in the case of the richer classes who keep the <i lang=
"ms">kanduri ampat puloh hari</i>, or forty days&rsquo; feast, and the
<i lang="ms">kanduri m&#277;ratus hari</i>, or 100 days&rsquo; feast,
whilst the anniversary is also kept as a holiday by all who wish to
show respect for the deceased. This closes the usual funeral
ceremonies, but a day is generally chosen at pleasure in the month of
Ramthan or Maulud for the purpose of offering prayers and feasting the
ancestors.</p>
<p class="par">The only difference made in the case of the death of a
woman is that the washing of the corpse devolves upon women, whilst in
the case of very young infants the <i lang="ms">talkin</i> is sometimes
omitted. The woman&rsquo;s <i lang="ms">nisan</i>, as has been
explained, is distinguished by its shape.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21855src" href="#xd21e21855" name="xd21e21855src">115</a> The
temporary <i lang="ms">nisan</i> may be replaced by a permanent one at
any time after the funeral. At the time the grave is made up, four
planks (<i lang="ms">dapor-dapor</i>), with the upper edges and ends
roughly carved and scalloped, are placed round the grave mound
(<i lang="ms">tanah mati</i>) to keep the earth from falling down.
Whenever the grave is thus finally made up a feast is held, but from
the necessities of the case this pious duty is generally left to the
rich.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;The successful practice of (Malay) medicine
must be based on the fundamental principle of &lsquo;preserving the
balance of power&rsquo; among the four elements. This is chiefly to be
effected by constant attention to, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb409" href="#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span>moderation in, diet.
To enforce these golden precepts, passages from the Kor&#257;n are
plentifully quoted against excess in eating or drinking. Air, they say,
is the cause of heat and moisture, and earth of cold and dryness. They
assimilate the constitution and passions of man to the twelve signs of
the Zodiac, and the seven planets, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The mysterious sympathy between man and external
nature ... was the basis of that system of supernatural magic which
prevailed in Europe during the Middle Ages.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e21879src" href="#xd21e21879" name="xd21e21879src">116</a></p>
<p class="par">The foregoing quotation shows that the distinctive
features of the Aristotelian hygienic theory, as borrowed by the Arabs,
did eventually filter through (in some cases) until they reached the
Malays. Such direct references, however, to Greek theories are of the
rarest character, and can hardly be considered typical.</p>
<p class="par">Most of the more important rites practised by the Malay
medicine-men (<i lang="ms">Bomor</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e21891src" href="#xd21e21891" name="xd21e21891src">117</a>) may be
divided into two well-defined parts. Commencing with a ceremonial
&ldquo;inspection&rdquo; (the counterpart of our modern
&ldquo;diagnosis&rdquo;), the Bomor proceeds to carry out a therapeutic
ceremony, the nature of which is decided by the results of the
&ldquo;inspection.&rdquo; For the purposes of the diagnosis he resorts
to divination, by means of omens taken from the smoke of the burning
censer, from the position of coins thrown into water-jars (<i lang=
"ms">batu buyong</i>), and parched rice floating upon the water&rsquo;s
surface.</p>
<p class="par">The therapeutic rites, on the other hand, may be roughly
classified as follows according to their types:<a class="noteref" id=

a row at the side of the room. They are a little too large in
proportion.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Page 410.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">I shall take each of the types in order.</p>
<p class="par">For the water-jar ceremony three jars (<i lang=
"ms">buyong</i>) containing water are brought to the sick man&rsquo;s
room and decorated with the fringe or necklace of plaited cocoa-nut
leaves, which is called &ldquo;Centipedes&rsquo; Feet&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">jari &rsquo;lipan</i>). A fourth jar should contain a sort of
bouquet of artificial flowers to serve as an attraction to the sick
man&rsquo;s soul (<i lang="ms">s&#277;mangat</i>). You will also
require a tray filled with the usual accessories of Malay magic
ceremonies (incense, three sorts of rice, etc.), besides three wax
tapers, one of which you will plant upon the brim of each of the three
jars.</p>
<p class="par">When all is ready, drop the incense upon the embers, and
as the smoke rises repeat this charm:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

smell (<i lang="ms">hangit</i>) it is bad; but if it smells offensive
(<i lang="ms">busok</i>) no medicine can save the patient.</p>
<p class="par">Next, before you look into the jars, take handfuls of
&ldquo;parched,&rdquo; &ldquo;washed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;saffron&rdquo;

<p class="par">The most popular method of propitiating evil spirits
consists in the use of the sacrificial tray called Anchak.</p>

wood,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22311src" href="#xd21e22311"
name="xd21e22311src">122</a> usually from two to three feet square and

(<i lang="ms">jari&rsquo;lipan</i>) of plaited cocoa-nut leaf. Four
rattan &ldquo;suspenders&rdquo; of equal length (<i lang="ms">tali
p&#277;nggantong</i>) are fastened to the four corners, and are thence
carried up to meet at a point which may be from two to three feet above
the tray.</p>
<p class="par">These trays appear to be divisible into two classes,
according to the objects which they are intended to serve. In the one
case certain offerings (to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href=
"#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span>be described presently) are laid
upon the tray, which is carried out of the house to a suitable spot and
there suspended to enable the spirits for whom it is designed to feed
upon its contents.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22324src" href=
"#xd21e22324" name="xd21e22324src">123</a> In the other case certain
objects are deposited upon it, into which the evil spirits are
ceremoniously invited to enter, in which case it must obviously be got
rid of after the ceremony, and is therefore hung up in the jungle, or
set adrift in the sea or the nearest river; in the latter case it is
called the &ldquo;keeled sacrifice-tray&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">anchak
p&#277;lunas</i>), and falls into line with other objects which are
occasionally set adrift for the same purpose.</p>
<p class="par">The offerings placed on the sacrificial tray vary
considerably, according to the object of the ceremony, the means of the
person for whose benefit they are offered, the caprice of the
medicine-man who carries out the ceremony, and so on.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e22344src" href="#xd21e22344" name="xd21e22344src">124</a></p>
<p class="par">I shall therefore, in the present place, merely describe
the contents of a more or less typical tray, with the main points of
the accompanying ritual.</p>
<p class="par">The bottom of the tray having been lined with
banana-leaf, and thickly strewn with parched rice, there are deposited
in the tray itself five &ldquo;chews&rdquo; of betel-leaf, five native
&ldquo;cigarettes&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">rokok</i>), five wax tapers,
five small water-receptacles or <i lang="ms">limas</i> (made of
banana-leaf and skewered together at each end), and five copper cents
(or dollars). The articles just enumerated are divided into five
portions, one of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href=
"#pb416" name="pb416">416</a>]</span>is deposited in the centre of the
tray, and the remainder in its four corners. Besides this there are to
be deposited in the tray fourteen portions of meat (of fowl, goat, or
buffalo, as the case may be), and fourteen portions of Malay
&ldquo;cakes,&rdquo; care being taken in each case to see that there
are seven portions of cooked and seven portions of uncooked food
provided. The rattan &ldquo;suspenders,&rdquo; again, are hung with two
sets of ornamental rice-receptacles made of plaited cocoa-nut leaf
(fourteen of the long-shaped kind, or <i lang="ms">l&#277;pat</i>, and
fourteen of the diamond-shaped kind, or <i lang="ms">k&#277;tupat</i>).
Besides this, two sets of (cooked and uncooked) packets of rice (each
stained a different colour) are sometimes deposited in the tray, the
colours used being white, yellow, red, black, blue, green, and purple.
The only other articles required for the tray are a couple of eggs, of
which one must, of course, be cooked and the other raw.</p>
<p class="par">Of the water-receptacles, those in alternate corners are
filled with water and cane-juice, the central receptacle being filled
with the blood of the fowl (or other animal slain for the
sacrifice).</p>
<p class="par">Upon the ground, exactly underneath the tray, should be
deposited the feathers, feet, entrails, etc., of the fowl, portions of
whose flesh have been used for the tray, together with the refuse of
the parched rice and a censer. Strictly speaking, a white and a black
fowl should be killed, but only half of each cooked, the remainder
being left raw. The &ldquo;portions&rdquo; of fowl are as small as they
can possibly be, a mere symbol (<i lang="ms">&#703;isharat</i>) of each
kind of food being all that the spirits are supposed to require.
Sometimes funnel-shaped rice-receptacles are used, which are skewered
with a bamboo skewer and called <i lang="ms">k&#277;ronchot</i>.
Occasionally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>a standard censer (<i lang="ms">sangga?</i>) is
used, the end of a piece of bamboo being split up and bent or opened
outwards for several inches, and a piece of rattan (cane) being wound
in and out among the split ends, so as to form a sort of funnel (about
nine inches in diameter at the top), which is lined with banana leaf,
filled with earth, and planted vertically in the ground, great care
being taken to see that it does not lean out of the perpendicular. Live
embers are placed upon it, incense crumbled over it (between the finger
and thumb), and the appropriate charm recited. A specimen of a charm or
formula used during the burning of incense will be found in the
Appendix.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22386src" href="#xd21e22386" name=

<p class="par">Of the food in the tray, the cooked food is for the king

be the Wild Huntsman (<i lang="ms">Hantu P&#277;mburu</i>) and
sometimes <i lang="ms">Batara Guru</i>, and the uncooked for his
following. But of the two eggs, the uncooked one is alleged to be for
the Land-spirit (<i>i.e.</i> the Wild Huntsman), and the cooked for the
Sea-spirit; this assertion, however, requires some further
investigation before it can be unreservedly accepted.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>The Wave-Offering</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On one occasion, during my residence in the Kuala
Langat district of Selangor, I had the good fortune to be present at
the &ldquo;waving&rdquo; of a sacrificial tray (<i lang=
"ms">anchak</i>) containing offerings to the spirits. The account of
this ceremony, which I shall now give, is made up from notes taken
during the actual performance. To commence:&mdash;The Pawang sat down
with his back to the patient, facing a multitude of dishes which
contained the various portions of cooked and uncooked food. The tray
itself was suspended at a height of about three feet from the ground in
the centre of the room, just in front of the Pawang&rsquo;s head.
Lighting a wax taper and removing the yam-leaf covering from the mouth
of the jar containing &ldquo;holy&rdquo; water, the Pawang now
&ldquo;inspected&rdquo; the water in the jar by gazing intently into
its depths, and re-extinguished the taper. Then he fumigated his hands
in the smoke of the censer, extended them for a brief interval over the
&ldquo;holy&rdquo; water, took the censer in both hands, described
three circles round the jar with it, set it down again, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name="pb419">419</a>]</span>and
stirred the water thrice with a small knife or dagger (<i lang=
"ms">k&rsquo;ris</i>), the blade of which he kept in the water while he
muttered a charm to himself. Then he charmed the betel-stand and the
first dish of cooked food, pushing the latter aside and covering it
with a small dish-cover as he finished the charm. Next, at the hands of
one of the company, he accepted, in two pieces, five cubits of yellow
cloth (yellow being the royal colour), and a small vessel of &ldquo;oil
of Celebes,&rdquo; with which, it may be added, he anointed the palms
of both hands before he touched the cloth itself. Next, he fumigated
the latter in the smoke of the censer, one end of the cloth being
grasped firmly in the right hand, and the remainder of it being passed
round the right wrist, and over and under the right arm, while the
loose end trailed across his lap. Next, after repeating the usual
charm, he breathed on one end of the cloth, passed the whole of the
cloth through his fingers, fumigated it, and laid it aside; took an egg
which was presented to him upon a tray, and deposited it exactly in the
centre of a large dish of parched rice. Next, he pushed aside the jar
of holy water, lowered the tray by means of the cord attached to it
(which passed over a beam), and proceeded to supervise the preparation
of the tray, which was being decorated with the &ldquo;centipede&rdquo;
fringe by one of the company acting as an assistant. The fringe having
been fitted by the latter to the edges of the tray, and the latter
lined with three thicknesses of banana leaf, the Pawang described a
circle round it thrice with the censer, and then deposited the censer
upon the floor, exactly under the centre of the tray. Then anointing
his hands again he passed them over both tray and fringe. A brief pause
followed, and then the Pawang took the larger piece of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=
"pb420">420</a>]</span>yellow cloth and wrapped it like a royal robe
around the shoulders of the patient as he sat up inside his mosquito
curtain. Another brief pause, and the Pawang betook himself once more
to the filling of the tray. Taking a large bowl of parched rice, he
scooped up the rice in his hands, and let it run through his fingers
into the tray, until there was a layer of parched rice in the latter of
at least an inch in depth, and then deposited the egg, already alluded
to, in the very centre of the parched rice. Next he took a comb of
bananas (presented by one of the company), and cutting them off one by
one deposited them in a dish, from which they were presently
transferred to the tray. The Pawang now returned to the patient, and
kneeling down in front of him, fumigated his hands in the smoke of the
censer, and then, muttering a charm, wrapped the smaller piece of
yellow cloth turban-wise round his own head, and slowly and carefully
pushed the yellow-robed patient (who was still in a sitting posture)
forward until he reached a spot which was exactly under the centre of
the tray, and which faced, I was told, the &ldquo;place of the Rising
Sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The long straw-coloured streamers of the tray-fringe
dropped gracefully around the patient on every side, and had it not
been for occasional bright glimpses of the yellow cloth he would have
been almost invisible.</p>
<p class="par">The censer, voluming upwards its ash-gray smoke, was now
passed from hand to hand three times round the patient, and finally
deposited on the floor at his feet.</p>
<p class="par">The loading of the tray now recommenced, and the Pawang
standing up and looking towards the south, deposited in it carefully
the several portions of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href=
"#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span>&ldquo;cooked&rdquo; offerings
(the sum of the various portions making up a whole fowl). Then, after
washing his hands, he added to the tray small portions of rice
variously prepared and coloured (viz. parched and washed rice, and rice
stained yellow (saffron), green, red, blue, and black, seven kinds in
all). Next he deposited in the tray the uncooked portions, whose sum
also amounted to a whole fowl, then, after a further hand-washing, the
&ldquo;cakes,&rdquo; and finally, after a last washing, he fastened to
the &ldquo;suspenders&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22511src" href=
"#xd21e22511" name="xd21e22511src">126</a> of the tray the small
ornamental rice-bags called <i lang="ms">k&#277;tupat</i> and <i lang=
"ms">l&#277;pat</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22523src" href=
"#xd21e22523" name="xd21e22523src">127</a></p>
<p class="par">But the list of creature comforts provided for the
spirits comprised other things besides food. Five miniature
water-buckets, each manufactured from a strip of banana leaf skewered
together at each end with a bamboo pin, were now filled, the alternate
corner ones with water and cane-juice (called &ldquo;palm-toddy&rdquo;
in the Spirit Language), and the central one with the blood of the
fowls killed for the sacrifice. They were then duly deposited in the
tray by the Pawang. Five waxen tapers, to &ldquo;light the spirits to
their food,&rdquo; were next &ldquo;charmed&rdquo; and lighted, and
planted in the centre and four corners respectively.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, no doubt for the spirits&rsquo; after-dinner
enjoyment, five &ldquo;chews&rdquo; of betel-leaf and five native-made
cigarettes (tobacco rolled in strips of palm-leaf), were charmed and
actually lighted at a lamp, and deposited in the tray with the other
offerings, and at the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href=
"#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span>time five 50 cent (silver) pieces
of Straits money, called &ldquo;tray-stones,&rdquo; were added to the
medley, evidently with the object of preventing the good temper of the
spirits from being disturbed by &ldquo;shortness of cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The loading of the tray being now complete, the Pawang
walked thrice round the patient (who was still overshadowed by the
tray), and passed the censer round him thrice. Standing then with his
face to the east, so as to look in the same direction as the patient,
he grasped the &ldquo;suspenders&rdquo; of the tray with both hands at
their converging point, and thrice muttered a charm, giving a downward
tug to the cord of the tray at the end of each repetition. This done,
he removed the yellow cloth from his head, and fastened it round the
tray-cord at the point where the &ldquo;suspenders&rdquo; converged,
and then &ldquo;<i>waved</i>&rdquo; the offering by causing the loaded
tray with its flaring tapers to swing slowly backwards and forwards
just over the patient&rsquo;s head. Next, letting the tray slowly down
and detaching it from the cord, at the converging point, he again
&ldquo;<i>waved</i>&rdquo; it slowly to and fro amid the flaring of the
tapers, seven times in succession, and held it out for the patient to
spit into. When this was done he sallied out into the darkness of the
night carrying the tray, and gaining the jungle, suspended it from a
tree (of the kind called <i lang="ms">p&#277;tai b&#277;lalang</i>)
which had been selected that very day for the purpose. A white ant,
immediately settling upon the offering, was hailed by the Malays
present with great delight as a sign that the spirits had accepted the
offering, whereupon we all returned to the house and the company broke
up. The ceremony had commenced about 8 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>,
and lasted about an hour and a half, and the number of people
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>present was fourteen, seven male and seven
female, which was the number stipulated by the Pawang.</p>
<p class="par">Another form of &ldquo;propitiation&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">buang-buangan limas</i>) ceremony consists in loading a <i lang=
"ms">limas</i> with the offerings. The <i lang="ms">limas</i> is a
receptacle of about a span (<i lang="ms">sa-j&#277;ngkal</i>) in
length, made of banana-leaf folded together at the ends and skewered
with a bamboo pin. Inside it are deposited the offerings, which consist
of the following articles: a <i lang="ms">chupak</i> (half
cocoa-nutful) of &ldquo;parched&rdquo; rice, a set of three, five, or
seven bananas, a &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">sa-j&#277;mput</i>)
of &ldquo;saffron&rdquo; rice, a pinch of &ldquo;washed&rdquo; rice, a
native cigarette (<i lang="ms">rokok</i>), an egg, a wax taper, two
&ldquo;chews&rdquo; of betel-leaf, and a betel-leaf twisted up into the
shape of a spiral (<i lang="ms">pantat siput</i>). One (at least) of
the two &ldquo;chews&rdquo; of betel must be specially prepared, as it
is to be left behind for the spirits to chew, whilst the other is taken
back into the presence of the sick man, where the medicine-man chews it
and ejects the chewed leaf (<i lang="ms">di-s&#277;mbor</i>) upon the
&ldquo;small&rdquo; of the sick man&rsquo;s back. In the case of the
&ldquo;chew&rdquo; which is left behind for the spirits, the ordinary
portion of betel-nut must be replaced by nutmeg, the gambier by mace,
and the lime by &ldquo;oil of Celebes&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">minyak
Bugis</i>).</p>
<p class="par">When the ceremony of loading the <i lang="ms">limas</i>
is complete, it is carried down to the nearest river or sea, and there
set adrift with the following words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="par">Counter-charms for &ldquo;neutralising&rdquo; the active
principle of poisons form, as a rule, one of the most important
branches of the pharmacop&oelig;ic system among the less civilised
Malay tribes. A settled form of government and the softening of manners
due to contact with European civilisation has, however, diminished the
importance (I speak, of course, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425"
href="#pb425" name="pb425">425</a>]</span>from the Malay point of view)
of this branch of the subject in the Western Malay States of the
Peninsula, where poisoning cases are very rarely heard of. Malay women
have always possessed the reputation of being especially proficient in
the use of poison; ground glass and the furry spicules obtained from
the leaf-cases of some kinds of bamboo being their favourite
weapons.</p>
<p class="par">This idea (of using a charm to &ldquo;neutralise&rdquo;
the active principle of poison) has been extended by Malay medicine-men
to cover all cases where any evil principle (even, for instance, a
familiar spirit) is believed to have entered the sick person&rsquo;s
system. All such charms are piously regarded by devout Muhammadans as
gifts due to the mercy of God, who is believed to have sent them down
to the Prophet Muhammad by the hand of his servant Gabriel. This
doctrine we find clearly stated in the charms themselves, <i>e.g.</i>
(somewhat tautologically):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line">To bring them unto Muhammad.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Badi</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The next class of medicinal ceremonies consists of
rites intended to effect the expulsion from the patient&rsquo;s body of
all kinds of evil influences or principles, such as may have entered
into a man who has unguardedly touched a dead animal or bird from which
the <i lang="ms">badi</i> has not yet been expelled, or who has met
with the Wild Huntsman in the forest.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e22796src" href="#xd21e22796" name="xd21e22796src">133</a></p>
<p class="par"><i lang="ms">Badi</i> is the name given to the evil
principle which, according to the view of Malay medicine-men, attends
(like an evil angel) everything that has life. [It must not be
forgotten when we find it used of inert objects, such as trees, and
even of stones or minerals, that these too are animate objects from the
Malay point of view.] Von de Wall describes it as &ldquo;the enchanting
or destroying influence which issues from anything, <i>e.g.</i> from a
tiger which one sees,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22812src" href=
"#xd21e22812" name="xd21e22812src">134</a> from a poison-tree which one
passes under, from the saliva of a mad dog, from an action which one
has performed; the contagious principle of morbid matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Hence the ceremony which purports to drive out this evil
principle is of no small importance in Malay <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>medicine. I may take this opportunity of
pointing out that I have used the word &ldquo;mischief&rdquo; to
translate it when dealing with the charms, as this is the nearest
English equivalent which I have been able to find; indeed, it appears a
very fairly exact equivalent when we remember its use in English in
such phrases as &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got the mischief in it,&rdquo; which
is sometimes used even of inanimate objects.</p>
<p class="par">There are a hundred and ninety of these mischiefs,
according to some, according to others, a hundred and ninety-three.
Their origin is very variously given. One authority says that the first
<i lang="ms">badi</i> sprang from three drops of Adam&rsquo;s blood
(which were spilt on the ground). Another (rather inconsistently)
declares that the &ldquo;mischief&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">badi</i>)
residing in an iguana (<i lang="ms">biawak</i>) was the origin of all
subsequent &ldquo;mischiefs,&rdquo; yet adds later that the
&ldquo;Heart of Timber&rdquo; was their origin, and yet again that the
yellow glow at sunset (called Mambang Kuning or the &ldquo;Yellow
Deity&rdquo;) was their origin. These two latter are, perhaps the most
usual theories, but a third medicine-man declares that the first
<i lang="ms">badi</i> was the offspring of the Jin
(&ldquo;genie&rdquo;) Ibn Ujan (Ibnu Jan?), who resides in the clouds
(or caverns?) and hollows of the hills. Thus do Malay medicine-men
disagree.</p>
<p class="par">These &ldquo;mischiefs&rdquo; reside not only in
animate, but also in inanimate objects. Thus in one of the
elephant-charms given in the Appendix several different
&ldquo;mischiefs&rdquo; are described as residing in earth, ant-hills,
wood, water, stone, and elephants (or rhinoceroses) respectively.
Again, in a deer-charm, various &ldquo;mischiefs&rdquo; are requested
to return to their place of origin, <i>i.e.</i> to the Iguana (strictly
speaking, the Monitor Lizard), Heart of Timber, and the Yellow Glow of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=
"pb429">429</a>]</span>Sunset. Yet another deer-charm calls upon
&ldquo;Badi&rdquo; (as the offspring of the Jin Ibn Ujan, who resides
in the clouds and hollows of the hills), to return thereto.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e22855src" href="#xd21e22855" name=
"xd21e22855src">135</a></p>
<p class="par">I will now proceed to describe the ceremony of
&ldquo;casting out&rdquo; these &ldquo;mischiefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The chief occasions on which this casting out takes
place are, first, when somebody is ill, and his sickness is attributed
to his accidental contact with (and consequent &ldquo;possession
by&rdquo;) one of these mischiefs; and, secondly, when any wild animal
or bird is killed. The ceremony of casting out the mischief from the
carcases of big game will be found described under the heading of
&ldquo;Hunting Ceremonies.&rdquo; I shall here confine myself to a
brief description of the ceremony as conducted for the benefit of sick
persons.</p>
<p class="par">First make up a bunch of leaves (<i lang=
"ms">sa-ch&#277;rek</i>), consisting of the shrubs called <i lang=
"ms">pulut-pulut</i> and <i lang="ms">s&#277;laguri</i>, with branches
of the <i lang="ms">gandarusa</i> and <i lang="ms">l&#277;njuang
merah</i> (red drac&aelig;na), all of which are wrapped together in a
leaf of the <i lang="ms">si-pulih</i>, and tied round with a piece of
tree-bark (<i lang="ms">kulit t&rsquo;rap</i>), or the <i lang=
"ms">akar gasing-gasing</i>. With this leaf-brush you are to cast out
the mischief. Then you grate on to a saucer small pieces of ebony wood,
brazil wood, &ldquo;<i lang="ms">laka</i>&rdquo; wood, sandalwood, and
eagle-wood (lignaloes), mix them with water, putting in a few small
pieces of scrap-iron, and rub the patient all over with the mixture.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name=
"pb430">430</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As you do this, repeat the appropriate charm; then take
the brush of leaves and stroke the patient all over downwards from head
to foot, saying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Peace be with you, Prophet Noah, to whom belong
the trees,</p>
<p class="line">And Prophet Elias who planted them.</p>
<p class="line">I crave as a boon the leaves of these shrubs</p>
<p class="line">To be a drug and a neutralising (power)</p>
<p class="line">Within the body, frame, and person of
<i>So-and-So</i>.</p>
<p class="line">If you (addressing the leaves) refuse to enter (the
body of <i>So-and-So</i>),</p>
<p class="line">You shall be cursed with my &lsquo;curse of the nine
countries,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">By (the power of) the word &lsquo;There is no god but
God,&rsquo;&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Whilst reciting the above, stand upright, close to
the patient&rsquo;s head, grasping a spear in your left hand. Brandish
this spear over the body of the patient, drawing a long
breath.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e22976src" href="#xd21e22976" name=
"xd21e22976src">136</a></p>
<p class="par">This spear must afterwards be ransomed, (say) for forty
cents; in default of which payment it is forfeited to the
medicine-man.</p>
<p class="par">The directions for another form of the ceremony just
described (&ldquo;casting out the mischief&rdquo;), are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Whenever a person is suffering from the influence of a
waxen image (such as is described elsewhere),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e23015src" href="#xd21e23015" name="xd21e23015src">137</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>you must rub him (or her) all over with limes in
order to &ldquo;cast out the mischief.&rdquo; These limes must be of
seven different kinds, and you will require three of each kind. When
you have got them, fumigate them with incense and repeat the
appropriate charm, which is practically an appeal addressed to the
spirit of the limes to assist in extracting the poisonous principle
from the body of the sick man:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Peace be with you, O Lelang,</p>
<p class="line">We have been brothers from the former time until
now,</p>
<p class="line">I am fain to order you to assist me in extracting
everything that is poisonous</p>
<p class="line">From the body and limbs of <i>So-and-So</i>.</p>
<p class="line">Break not your solemn promise,</p>
<p class="line">Break not your plighted faith,</p>
<p class="line">And use not deceit or wiles,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Of course the luckless spirit is told that if he
does not do exactly as he is bidden he must expect the curse to
follow.</p>
<p class="par">This charm must be repeated overnight, and early next
morning three thicknesses of <i lang="ms">birah</i> leaves must be laid
down (for the patient to stand upon during the lustration). The seven
sorts of limes are at the same time to be squeezed into a bowl and
divided into three portions. These portions are to be used three times
during the day, at sunrise, noon, and sundown respectively, partly for
washing off the cosmetics (which are rubbed all over the body), and
partly as a medicinal draught or potion.</p>
<p class="par">In the morning the cosmetic must be white (<i lang=
"ms">b&#277;dak puteh lulut</i>), at noon it must be red (<i lang=
"ms">b&#277;dak merah</i>), and at sundown black (<i lang=
"ms">b&#277;dak hitam</i>). The &ldquo;trash&rdquo; of the limes (after
squeezing) is wrapped up in a <i lang="ms">birah</i> leaf at evening,
and either carried out to the sea (into which it is dropped), or
deposited ashore at a safe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href=
"#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span>distance from the house. The only
special taboo mentioned for this ceremony is that the patient must not
during its continuance meet anybody who has come from a distance.</p>
<p class="par">Another very curious form of this ceremony of
&ldquo;casting out devils&rdquo; was described to me by a Kelantan
Malay. It is worked on the substitute or &ldquo;scapegoat&rdquo;
principle (<i lang="ms">tukar ganti</i>), and the idea is to make
little dough images of all kinds of birds, beasts, fishes, and even
inanimate objects (a few of the former being fowls, ducks, horses,
apes, buffaloes, bullocks, wild cattle (<i lang=
"ms">s&#277;ladang</i>), deer, mouse-deer, and elephants, besides those
enumerated in the charm itself, whilst exceptions are to be the
&ldquo;unlucky&rdquo; animals (<i lang="ms">b&#277;natang sial</i>)
such as cats, tigers, pigs, dogs, snakes, and iguanas). When made they
are to be deposited together in a heap upon a sacrificial tray
(<i lang="ms">anchak</i>), together with betel-leaves, cigarettes, and
tapers. One of the tapers is made to stand upon a silver dollar, with
the end of a piece of particoloured thread inserted between the dollar
and the foot of the taper; and the other end of this thread is given to
the patient to hold whilst the necessary charm is being repeated.</p>
<p class="par">Part of this charm is worth quoting, as it helps to
explain the line of thought on which the medicine-man is
working:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I have made a substitute for you,</p>
<p class="line">And engage you for hire.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="line">As for your wish to eat, I give you food,</p>
<p class="line">As for your wish to drink, I give you drink.</p>
<p class="line">Lo, I give you good measure whether of sharks,</p>
<p class="line">Skates, lobsters, crabs, shell-fish (both of land and
sea)&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Every kind of substitute I give you,</p>
<p class="line">Good measure whether of flesh or of blood, both cooked
and raw.</p>
<p class="line">Accept, accept duly this banquet of mine. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name="pb433">433</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">It was good at the first: if it is not good now,</p>
<p class="line">It is not I who give it.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The explanation of this part of the ceremony is
that the evil spirit, or &ldquo;mischief,&rdquo; is supposed to leave
the body of the sick man, and to proceed (guided, of course, by the
many-coloured thread which the patient holds in his hand) to enter into
the choice collection of &ldquo;scapegoats&rdquo; lying in the tray. As
soon as his devilship is got fairly into the tray, the medicine-man
looses three slip-knots (<i lang="ms">l&#277;pas-l&#277;pas</i>), and
repeats a charm to induce the evil spirit to go, and throws away the
untied knots outside the house.</p>
<p class="par">The original &ldquo;disease-boat&rdquo; used in Selangor
was a model of a special kind of Malay vessel called <i lang=
"ms">lanchang</i>. This <i lang="ms">lanchang</i> was a two-masted
vessel with galleries (<i lang="ms">dandan</i>) fore and aft, armed
with cannon, and used by Malay Rajas on the Sumatran coast. This latter
fact was, no doubt, one reason for its being selected as the type of
boat most likely to prove acceptable to the spirits. To make it still
further acceptable, however, the model was not unfrequently stained
with turmeric or saffron, yellow being recognised as the royal colour
among the Malays.</p>
<p class="par">Occasionally, on the other hand, a mere raft (<i lang=
"ms">rakit</i>) is set adrift, sometimes a small model of the <i lang=
"ms">balei</i> (state-chamber), and sometimes only a set of the
banana-leaf receptacles called <i lang="ms">limas</i>.</p>
<p class="par">The vessel in the case of an important person is
occasionally of great size and excellent finish&mdash;indeed, local
tradition has it that an exceptionally large and perfect specimen
(which was launched upon the Klang river in Selangor some years ago, on
the occasion of an illness of the Tungku &rsquo;Chik, eldest daughter
of the late Sultan), was actually towed down to sea by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>Government steam launch <i lang="ms">&#703;Abdul
Samad</i>. When all is ready the <i lang="ms">lanchang</i> is loaded
with offerings, which are of an exactly similar character to those
which are deposited on the sacrificial tray or <i lang=
"ms">anchak</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e23148src" href="#xd21e23148"
name="xd21e23148src">138</a> already described. Then one end of a piece
of yellow thread is fastened to the patient&rsquo;s wrist (the other
end being presumably made fast to the spirit-boat, or <i lang=
"ms">lanchang</i>); incense is burnt and a charm recited, the purport
of it being to persuade the evil spirits which have taken possession of
the patient to enter on board the vessel. This, when they are thought
to have done so, is then<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23185src" href=
"#xd21e23185" name="xd21e23185src">139</a> taken down to the sea or
river and set adrift, invariably at the ebb tide, which is supposed to
carry the boat (and the spirits with it) &ldquo;to another
country.&rdquo; One of the charms used at this stage of the ceremony
even mentions the name of the country to which the devils are to be
carried, the place singled out for this distinction being the Island of
Celebes! The passage in question runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Peace be unto you, Devils of the sea, and Demons
of the sea,</p>
<p class="line">Neither on cape, nor bay, nor sandbank be ye stuck or
stranded!</p>
<p class="line">This vessel (<i lang="ms">lanchang</i>) is that of

<p class="par first">I shall now proceed to describe the ceremony of
invoking the Tiger Spirit for the purpose of obtaining his assistance
in expelling a rival spirit of less power.</p>
<p class="par">In the autumn of 1896 (in the Kuala Langat District of
Selangor) the brother of my Malay collector &#703;Umar happening to
fall ill of some slight ailment, I asked and obtained permission to be
present at the ceremony of doctoring the patient. The time fixed for
the commencement of the ceremony (which is usually repeated for three
consecutive nights) was seven o&rsquo;clock on the following evening.
On reaching the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437"
name="pb437">437</a>]</span>house at the time appointed I was met by
&#703;Umar, and ascending the house-ladder, was invited to seat myself
upon a mat about two yards from the spot where the medicine-man was
expected to take up his position. Having done so, and looking round, I
found that there were in all nine persons present (including myself,
but exclusive of the Pawang, his wife, or the patient), and I was
informed that although it is not necessary for the same persons to be
present on each of the three nights, the greatest care must be taken to
see that the number of persons present, which should never, in
strictness, be an even number, does not vary from night to night,
because to allow any such variation would be to court disaster. Hence I
myself was only enabled to be present as a substitute for one of the
sick man&rsquo;s relatives who had been there on the preceding
night.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23347src" href="#xd21e23347" name=

"pb438" href="#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span>instead of the water.
These flowers were skilfully manufactured from plaited strips of
palm-leaf, and in addition to mere &ldquo;flowers&rdquo; represented
such objects as rings, cocoa-nuts, centipedes, doves, and the like, all
of which were made of the plaited fronds referred to. This invention
was intended (I was informed) to represent a pleasure-garden (<i lang=
"ms">taman bunga</i>), and indeed was so called; it was (I believe)
intended to attract the spirit whom it was the object of the ceremony
to invoke. In front of the three jars stood, as a matter of course, a
censer filled with burning embers, and a box containing the usual
accessories for the chewing of betel. Everything being now ready, the
medicine-man appeared and took his seat beside the censer, his wife, an
aged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>woman, whose office was to chant the invocation,
to her own accompaniment, taking her seat at the same time near the
head of the patient&rsquo;s sleeping-mat. Presently she struck up the
invocation (<i lang="ms">lagu p&#277;manggil</i>), and we listened in
rapt attention as the voice, at first weak and feeble with age,
gathered strength and wailed ever higher and shriller up to the climax
at the end of the chant. At the time it was hard to distinguish the
words, but I learnt from her afterwards that this was what she
sang:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">A number of rhymed stanzas follow which will be found in
the Appendix.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile the medicine-man was not backward in his
preparations for the proper reception of the spirit. First he scattered
incense on the embers and fumigated himself therewith,
&ldquo;shampooing&rdquo; himself, so to speak, with his hands, and
literally bathing in the cloud of incense which volumed up from the
newly-replenished censer and hung like a dense gray mist over his head.
Next he inhaled the incense through his nostrils, and announced in the
accents of what is called the spirit-language (<i lang="ms">bhasa
hantu</i>) that he was going to &ldquo;lie down.&rdquo; This he
accordingly did, reclining upon his back, and drawing the upper end of
his long plaid <i lang="ms">sarong</i> over his head so as to
completely conceal his features. The invocation was not yet ended, and
for some time we sat in the silence of expectation. At length, however,
the moment of possession arrived, and with a violent convulsive
movement, which was startling in its suddenness, the
&ldquo;Pawang&rdquo; rolled over on to his face. Again a brief interval
ensued, and a second but somewhat less violent spasm shook his frame,
the spasm being strangely followed by a dry and ghostly cough. A moment
later and the Pawang, still with shrouded head, was seated bolt upright
facing the tambourine player. Then he fronted round, still in a sitting
posture, until he faced the jars, and removed the yam-leaf covering
from the mouth of each jar in turn.</p>
<p class="par">Next he kindled a wax taper at the flame of a lamp
placed for the purpose just behind the jars, and planted it firmly on
the brim of the first jar by spilling a little wax upon the spot where
it was to stand. Two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441"
name="pb441">441</a>]</span>similar tapers having been kindled and
planted upon the brims of the second and third jars, he then partook of
a &ldquo;chew&rdquo; of betel-leaf (which was presented to him by one
of the women present), crooning the while to himself.</p>
<p class="par">This refreshment concluded, he drew from his girdle a
bezoar or talismanic stone (<i lang="ms">batu p&#277;nawar</i>), and
proceeded to rub it all over the patient&rsquo;s neck and shoulders.
Then, facing about, he put on a new white jacket and head-cloth which
had been placed beside him for his use, and girding his plaid (<i lang=
"ms">sarong</i>) about his waist, drew from its sheath a richly-wrought
dagger (<i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i>) which he fumigated in the smoke
of the censer and returned to its scabbard.</p>
<p class="par">He next took three silver 20-cent pieces of
&ldquo;Straits&rdquo; coinage, to serve as <i lang="ms">batu
buyong</i>, or &ldquo;jar-stones,&rdquo; and after
&ldquo;charming&rdquo; them dropped each of the three in turn into one
of the water-jars, and &ldquo;inspected&rdquo; them intently as they
lay at the bottom of the water, shading, at the same time, his eyes
with his hand from the light of the tapers. He now charmed several
handfuls of rice (&ldquo;parched,&rdquo; &ldquo;washed,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;saffron&rdquo; rice), and after a further inspection declared,
in shrill, unearthly accents, that each of the coins was lying exactly
under its own respective taper, and that therefore his
&ldquo;child&rdquo; (the sick man) was very dangerously ill, though he
might yet possibly recover with the aid of the spirit. Next, scattering
the rice round the row of jars (the track of the rice thus forming an
ellipse), he broke off several small blossom-stalks from a sheaf of
areca-palm blossom, and making them up with sprays of <i lang=
"ms">champaka</i> into three separate bouquets, placed one of these
improvised nosegays in each of the three jars of water. On the floor at
the back of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442"
name="pb442">442</a>]</span>row of jars he next deposited a piece of
white cloth, five cubits in length, which he had just previously
fumigated. Again drawing the dagger already referred to, the Pawang now
successively plunged it up to the hilt into each of the three bouquets
(in which hostile spirits might, I was told, possibly be lurking). Then
seizing an unopened blossom-spathe of the areca-palm, he anointed the
latter all over with &ldquo;oil of Celebes,&rdquo; extracted the sheaf
of palm-blossom from its casing, fumigated it, and laid it gently
across the patient&rsquo;s breast. Rapidly working himself up into a
state of intense excitement, and with gestures of the utmost vehemence,
he now proceeded to &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; the patient with the sheaf of
blossom rapidly downwards, in the direction of the feet, on reaching
which he beat out the blossom against the floor. Then turning the
patient over on to his face, and repeating the stroking process, he
again beat out the blossom, and then sank back exhausted upon the
floor, where he lay face downwards, with his head once more enveloped
in the folds of the <i lang="ms">sarong</i>.</p>
<p class="par">A long interval now ensued, but at length, after many
convulsive twitchings, the shrouded figure arose, amid the intense
excitement of the entire company, and went upon its hands and feet. The
Tiger Spirit had taken possession of the Pawang&rsquo;s body, and
presently a low, but startlingly life-like growl&mdash;the unmistakable
growl of the dreaded &ldquo;Lord of the Forest&rdquo;&mdash;seemed to
issue from somewhere under our feet, as the weird shrouded figure began
scratching furiously at the mat upon which it had been quietly lying,
and then, with occasional pauses for the emission of the growls, which
had previously startled us, and the performance of wonderful cat-like
leaps, rapidly licked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href=
"#pb443" name="pb443">443</a>]</span>up the handfuls of rice which had
been thrown upon the floor in front of it. This part of the performance
lasted, however, but a few minutes, and then the evident excitement of
the onlookers was raised to fever pitch, as the bizarre, and, as it
seemed to our fascinated senses, strangely brute-like form stooped
suddenly forward, and slowly licked over, as a tigress would lick its
cub, the all but naked body of the patient&mdash;a performance (to a
European) of so powerfully nauseating a character that it can hardly be
conceived that any human being could persist in it unless he was more
or less unconscious of his actions. At all events, after his complete
return to consciousness at the conclusion of the ceremony, even the
Pawang experienced a severe attack of nausea, such as might well be
supposed to be the result of his performance. Meanwhile, however, the
ceremony continued. Reverting to a sitting posture (though still with
shrouded head), the Pawang now leaned forward over the patient, and
with the point of his dagger drew blood from his own arm; then rising
to his feet he engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand combat with his
invisible foe (the spirit whom he had been summoned to exorcise). At
first his weapon was the dagger, but before long he discarded this, and
laid about him stoutly enough with the sheaf of areca-palm blossom.</p>
<p class="par">Presently, however, he quieted down somewhat, and
commenced to &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; the sick man (as before) with the
sheaf of palm-blossom, beating out the blossom upon the floor as usual
at the end of the operation. Then sitting down again and crooning to
himself, he partook of betel-leaf, faced round towards the patient and
stooped over him, muttering as he did so, and passing his hands all
over the prostrate form. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href=
"#pb444" name="pb444">444</a>]</span>Next he turned once more to the
jars and again plunged his dagger into each of them in turn (to make
sure that the evil spirit was not lurking in them), and then drawing
his head-cloth over his head so as to completely hide his face, he once
more took his seat beside the patient, stooping over him from time to
time and crooning charms as he did so.</p>
<p class="par">Finally he clapped his hands, removed his head-cloth,
&ldquo;stroked&rdquo; the patient over and flicked him with the corners
of it, and then shrouding himself once more in the <i lang=
"ms">sarong</i>, lay down at full length in a state of complete
exhaustion. A pause of about ten minutes&rsquo; duration now followed,
and then with sundry convulsive twitchings the Pawang returned to
consciousness and sat up, and the ceremony was over.</p>
<p class="par">The following description of a ceremony similar to the
one just described is taken from <i>Malay Sketches</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">b&#277;r-hantu</i> is, of
course, a survival of pr&aelig;-Islam darkness, and the priests
abominate it, or say they do; but they have to be a little careful,
because the highest society affects the practice of the Black Art.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To return to the king&rsquo;s house. In the
middle of the floor was spread a <i lang="ms">pu&acirc;dal</i>, a small
narrow mat, at one end of which was seated a middle-aged woman dressed
like a man in a short-sleeved jacket, trousers, a <i lang=
"ms">s&acirc;rong</i>, and a scarf fastened tightly round her waist. At
the other end of the mat was a large newly-lighted candle in a
candlestick. Between the woman and the taper were two or three small
vessels containing rice coloured with turmeric, parched <i lang=
"ms">padi</i>, and perfumed water. An attendant sat near at hand.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The woman in male attire was the <i lang=
"ms">P&acirc;wang</i>, the Raiser of Spirits, the Witch, not of Endor,
but of as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name=
"pb445">445</a>]</span>great repute in her own country and among her
own people. In ordinary life she was an amusing lady named Raja Ngah, a
scion of the reigning house on the female side, and a member of a
family skilled in all matters pertaining to occultism. In a corner of
the room were five or six girls holding native drums, instruments with
a skin stretched over one side only, and this is beaten usually with
the fingers. The leader of this orchestra was the daughter of Raja
Ngah.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shortly after I sat down, the proceedings began
by the <i lang="ms">P&acirc;wang</i> covering her head and face with a
silken cloth, while the orchestra began to sing a weird melody in an
unknown tongue. I was told it was the spirit language; the air was one
specially pleasing to a particular <i lang="ms">Jin</i>, or Spirit, and
the invocation, after reciting his praises, besought him to come from
the mountains or the sea, from underground or overhead, and relieve the
torments of the King.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As the song continued, accompanied by the
rhythmical beating of the drums, the <i lang="ms">P&acirc;wang</i> sat
with shrouded head in front of the lighted taper, holding in her right
hand against her left breast a small sheaf of the grass called <i lang=
"ms">daun sambau</i>, tied tightly together and cut square at top and
bottom.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This <i lang="ms">ch&acirc;dak</i> she shook,
together with her whole body, by a stiffening of the muscles, while all
eyes were fixed upon the taper.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At first the flame was steady, but by and by, as
the singers screamed more loudly to attract the attention of the
laggard Spirit, the wick began to quiver and flare up, and it was
manifest to the initiated that the <i lang="ms">Jin</i> was introducing
himself into the candle. By some means the <i lang=
"ms">P&acirc;wang</i>, who was now supposed to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name="pb446">446</a>]</span>be
&lsquo;possessed&rsquo; and no longer conscious of her actions, became
aware of this, and she made obeisance to the taper, sprinkling the
floor round it with saffron-coloured rice and perfumed water; then,
rising to her feet and followed by the attendant, she performed the
same ceremony before each male member of the reigning family present in
the room, murmuring all the while a string of gibberish addressed to
the Spirit. This done, she resumed her seat on the mat, and, after a
brief pause, the minstrels struck up a different air, and, singing the
praises of another <i lang="ms">Jin</i>, called upon him to come and
relieve the King&rsquo;s distress.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I ascertained that each Malay State has its own
special Spirits, each district is equally well provided, and there are

<p class="par">&ldquo;These four are known as <i lang="ms">Jin

Sultan and the State. As one star exceeds another in glory, so one
<i lang="ms">Jin</i> surpasses another in renown, and I have named them
in the order of their greatness. In their honour four white and crimson
umbrellas were hung in the room, presumably for their use when they
arrived from their distant homes. Only the Sultan of the State is
entitled to traffic with these distinguished Spirits; when summoned
they decline to move unless appealed to with their own special
invocations, set to their own peculiar music, sung by at least four
singers, and led by a <i lang="ms">B&#277;duan</i> (singer) of the
royal family. The <i lang="ms">Jin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447"

presence is required, but the other three have to be satisfied with the
instruments I have described.</p>

Raja Ngah&rsquo;s special familiar, and a host of others. Most <i lang=

and several of these were carrying on similar proceedings in adjoining
buildings, in order that the sick monarch might reap all the benefits
to be derived from a consultation of experts, and as one spirit after
another notified his advent by the upstarting flame of the taper, it
was impossible not to feel that one was getting into the very best
society.</p>

high and shaped like this diagram, had been placed on the floor near
the <i>P&acirc;wang&rsquo;s</i> mat. The stand was decorated with
yellow cloth; in its centre stood an enormous candle, while round it
were gaily-decorated rice and toothsome delicacies specially prized by
<i lang="ms">Jin</i>. There was just room to sit on this stand, which
is called <i lang="ms">P&#277;tr&acirc;na panchal&ocirc;gam</i>
(meaning a seat of this particular shape), and the Sultan, supported by
many attendants, was brought out and sat upon it. A veil was placed on

round the taper, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448"

into his hand an enormous <i lang="ms">ch&acirc;dak</i> of grass,
calmly awaited the coming of the <i lang="ms">Jin Ka-r&acirc;ja-an</i>,
while the minstrels shouted for him with all their might.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Sultan sat there for some time, occasionally
giving a convulsive shudder, and when this taper had duly flared up,
and all the rites had been performed, His Highness was conducted back
again to his couch, and the <i lang="ms">P&acirc;wang</i> continued her
ministrations alone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Whilst striding across the floor she suddenly
fell down as though shot, and it was explained to me that <i lang=

dish-cover, and that the sight always frightened him to such an extent
that his <i lang="ms">P&acirc;wang</i> fell down. The cause of offence
was removed, and the performance continued.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are other spirits who cannot bear the
barking of a dog, the mewing of a cat, and so on.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Just before dawn there was a sudden confusion
within the curtains which hid the Sultan&rsquo;s couch; they were
thrown aside, and there lay the King, to all appearance in a swoon. The
<i lang="ms">Jin Ka-r&acirc;ja-an</i> had taken possession of the sick
body, and the mind was no longer under its owner&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For a little while there was great excitement,
and then the King recovered consciousness, was carried to a side
verandah, and a quantity of cold water poured over him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So ended the <i>s&eacute;ance</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shortly after, the Sultan, clothed and in his
right mind, sent to say he would like to speak to me. He told me he
took part in this ceremony to please his people, and because it was a
very old custom, and he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href=

<p class="par">The ceremony called <i lang="ms">M&#277;ngalin</i>, or

from the sick man (<i>vide supra</i>) in or to drive away all evil

roll it all over the skin of the patient&rsquo;s body in order to draw
out all poisonous influences (<i lang="ms">m&#277;nchabut sagala
bisa-bisa</i>). Then if you find inside the ball of dough after opening
it an infinitesimally small splinter of bone, or a few red hairs, you
will know that these belong to the evil spirit who has been plaguing
the patient. The charm to be used when rolling the ball of dough over
the skin runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">A second charm of great length follows, the object
of which is to drive out the evil spirit in possession of the man.</p>
<p class="par">An example of this form of cure as practised by Malay
medicine-men is referred to by Mr. Clifford, who, in speaking of his
punkah-puller, Umat, says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was soon after his marriage that his trouble
fell upon Umat, and swept much of the sunshine from his life. He
contracted a form of ophthalmia, and for a time was blind. Native
Medicine Men doctored him, and drew sheaves of needles and bunches of
thorns from his eyes, which they declared were the cause of his
affliction. These miscellaneous odds and ends used to be brought to me
at breakfast-time, floating, most unappetisingly, in a shallow cup
half-full of water; and Umat went abroad with eye-sockets stained
crimson, or black, according to the fancy of the native physician. The
aid of an English doctor was called in, but Umat was too thoroughly a
Malay to trust the more simple remedies prescribed to him, and though
his blindness was relieved, and he became able to walk without the aid
of a staff, his eyesight could never really be given back to
him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23763src" href="#xd21e23763"

<p class="par">In the above connection I may remark that, whether from
the working of their own imaginations or otherwise, those who were
believed to be possessed by demons certainly suffered, and that
severely. H.H. Raja Kahar, the son of H.H. the late Sultan of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name=

during my residence in the Langat District, and shortly afterwards
commenced to pine away. He declared that the offending demon was
sitting in his skull, at the back of his head, and that it dragged up
and devoured everything that he swallowed. Hence he refused at length
to eat any sort of solid food, and gradually wasted away until he
became a mere skeleton, and went about imploring people to take a
hatchet and split his skull open, in order to extract the demon which
he believed it to contain. Gradually his strength failed, and at length
I learned from H.H. the Sultan (then Raja Muda) that all the Malays in
the neighbourhood had assembled to wail at his decease. As we strolled
among the cocoa-nut palms and talked, I told him of the many miraculous
cures which had attended cases of faith-healing in England, and
suggested, not of course expecting to be taken seriously, that he
should try the effect of such a cure upon his uncle, and &ldquo;make
believe&rdquo; to extract some &ldquo;mantises&rdquo; from the back of
his head. To my intense astonishment some days later, I learned that
this idea had been carried out during my temporary absence from the
district, and that the Muhammadan priest, after cupping him severely,
had shown him seven large mantises which he pretended to have extracted
from the back of his head. The experiment proved extraordinarily
successful, and Raja Kahar recovered at all events for the time. He
declared, however, that there were more of these mantises left, and
eventually suffered a relapse and died during my absence in England on
leave. For the time, however, the improvement was quite remarkable, and
when Said Mashahor, the P&#277;nghulu of Kerling, visited him a few
days later, Raja <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452"
name="pb452">452</a>]</span>Kahar, after an account of the cure from
his own point of view, declared that nobody would now believe that he
had been so ill, although &ldquo;no fewer than seven large
mantises&rdquo; had been &ldquo;extracted from his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I now give a specimen of the ceremonies used for
recalling a wandering soul by means of a dough figure or image
(<i lang="ms">gambar t&#277;pong</i>). It is not stated whether any of
the usual accessories of these figures (hair and nails, etc.) are mixed
with the dough, but an old and famous soul-doctor (&rsquo;Che Amal, of
Jugra) told me that the dough figure should be made, in strictness,
from the ball of kneaded dough which is rolled all over the
patient&rsquo;s body by the medicine-man during the
&ldquo;sucking-charm&rdquo; ceremony (<i lang="ms">m&#277;ngalin</i>).
The directions for making it run as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Make an image of dough, in length about nine inches, and
representing the opposite sex to that of the patient. Deposit it (on
its back) upon five cubits of white cloth, which must be folded up
small for the purpose, and then plant a miniature green umbrella (made
of cloth coated thickly with wax, and standing from four to five inches
in height) at the head of the image, and a small green clove-shaped
taper (of about the same height) at its feet. Then burn incense; take
three handfuls each of &ldquo;parched,&rdquo; &ldquo;washed,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;saffron&rdquo; rice, and scatter them thrice round the figure,
saying as you do so:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O Flying Paper,</p>
<p class="line">Come and fly into this cup.</p>
<p class="line">Pass by me like a shadow,</p>
<p class="line">I am applying the charm called the &lsquo;Drunken
Stars<a class="noteref" id="xd21e23794src" href="#xd21e23794" name=
"xd21e23794src">145</a><span class="corr" id="xd21e23800" title=

<p class="line">Drunken stars are on my left,</p>
<p class="line">A full moon (lit. 14th day moon) is on my right,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name=
"pb453">453</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">And the Umbrella of Si Lanchang is opposite to me</p>
<p class="line">Grant this by virtue of &lsquo;There is no god but
God,&rsquo;&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The statement that this dough image should
represent the opposite sex to that of the patient should be received
with caution, and requires further investigation to clear it up. My
informant explained that the &ldquo;Flying Paper&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">kr&#277;tas layang-layang</i>) referred to the soul-cloth, and the
&ldquo;cup&rdquo; to the image, but if this explanation is accepted, it
is yet not unlikely that a real cup was used in the original charm. The
&ldquo;drunken stars&rdquo; he explained as referring to the parched
rice scattered on his left, and the full moon to the eyes of the image.
Arguing from the analogy of other ceremonies conducted on the same
lines, the wandering soul would be recalled and induced to enter the
so-called cup (<i>i.e.</i> the dough image), and being transferred
thence to the soul-cloth underneath it, would be passed on to the
patient in the soul-cloth itself.</p>
<p class="par">Another way to recall a soul (which was taught me by
&rsquo;Che &#703;Abas of Kelantan) is to take seven betel-leaves with
meeting leaf-ribs (<i lang="ms">sirih b&#277;rt&#277;mu urat</i>), and
make them up into seven &ldquo;chews&rdquo; of betel. Then take a
plateful of saffron-rice, parched rice, and washed rice, and seven
pieces of parti-coloured thread (<i lang="ms">b&#277;nang pancharona
tujoh urat</i>) and an egg; deposit these at the feet of the sick man,
giving him one end of the thread to hold, and fastening the other end
to the egg.</p>
<p class="par">The soul is then called upon to return to the house
which it has deserted, is caught in a soul-cloth, and passed (it is
thought) first of all into the egg, and thence back into the
patient&rsquo;s body by means of the thread which connects the egg with
the patient. The charm runs as follows:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href="#pb454" name="pb454">454</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Peace be with you, O Breath!</p>

<p class="line">Hither, Filmy One, come hither!</p>

<p class="line">Here I sit and wave to you,</p>
<p class="line">Come at this very time, come at this very
moment,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Another way of recalling the soul is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Put some husked rice in a rice-bag (<i lang=
"ms">sumpit</i>) with an egg, a nail, and a candle-nut; scatter it
(<i lang="ms">kirei</i>) thrice round the patient&rsquo;s head, and
deposit the bag behind his pillow (<i lang="ms">di kapala tidor</i>),
after repeating this charm:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Cluck, cluck, souls of <i>So-and-so</i>, all
seven of you,</p>
<p class="line">Return ye unto your own house and house-ladder!</p>
<p class="line">Here are your parents come to summon you back,</p>
<p class="line">Back to your own house and house-ladder, your own

<p class="line">To the presence of your own parents, of your own family
and relations,</p>
<p class="line">Go not to and fro,</p>
<p class="line">But return to your own home.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">When three days have expired, gather up the rice
again and put it all back into the bag. If there is a grain over throw
it to the fowls, but if the measure falls short repeat the
ceremony.</p>
<p class="par">Again, in order to recall an escaping soul (<i lang=
"ms">riang <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455" name=
"pb455">455</a>]</span>s&#277;mangat</i>) the soul-doctor will take a
fowl&rsquo;s egg, seven small cockle-shells (<i lang="ms">kulit
k&rsquo;rang tujoh k&#277;ping</i>), and a <i lang=
"ms">kal</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e23917src" href="#xd21e23917"
name="xd21e23917src">146</a> of husked rice, and put them all together
into a rice-bag (<i lang="ms">sumpit</i>). He then rubs the bag all
over the skin of the patient&rsquo;s body, shakes the contents well up
together, and deposits it again close to the patient&rsquo;s head.
Whilst shaking them up he repeats the following charm:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Cluck! cluck! soul of this sick man,
<i>So-and-so</i>,</p>
<p class="line">Return into the frame and body of <i>So-and-so</i>,</p>
<p class="line">To your own house and house-ladder, to your own ground
and yard,</p>
<p class="line">To your own parents, to your own sheath.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">At the end of three days he measures the rice; if
the amount has increased, it signifies that the soul has returned; if
it is the same as before, it is still half out of the body; if less,
the soul has escaped and has not yet returned. In this case the soul is
expected to enter the rice and thus cause its displacement.</p>
<p class="par">Another method, not of recalling the soul, but of
stopping it in the act of escaping, is to take a gold ring, not less
than a <i lang="ms">maiam</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e23945src"
href="#xd21e23945" name="xd21e23945src">147</a> in weight, an iron
nail, a candle-nut (<i lang="ms">buah k&rsquo;ras</i>), three small
cockle-shells, three closed fistfuls of husked rice (<i lang=
"ms">b&rsquo;ras tiga g&#277;nggam bunyi</i>), and some parti-coloured
thread. These articles are all put in a rice-bag, and shaken up
together seven times every morning for three days, by which time the
soul is supposed to be firmly reseated in the patient&rsquo;s body;
then the rice is poured out at the door &ldquo;to let the fowls eat
it.&rdquo; The ring is tied to the patient&rsquo;s wrist by means of a
strip of tree-bark (<i lang="ms">kulit t&rsquo;rap</i>), and it is by
means of this string <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href="#pb456"
name="pb456">456</a>]</span>that the soul is supposed to return to its
body. When the shaking takes place the following charm must be
recited:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Peeling-Knife,<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="line">Avaunt ye, begone from here,</p>
<p class="line">And carry not off the soul of <i>So-and-so</i>,&rdquo;
etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">In conclusion, I will give a quotation from
<i>Malay Sketches</i>, which is perhaps as good an example as could be
given of the way in which the Black Art and the medical performances
that in their methods closely resemble it, are regarded by many
respectable Malays:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One evening I was discussing these various
superstitions with the Sultan of Perak, and I did not notice that the
spiritual teacher of His Highness had entered and was waiting to lead
the evening prayer. The <i lang="ms">guru</i>, or teacher, no doubt
heard the end of our conversation, and was duly scandalised, for the
next day I received from him a letter, of which the following is the
translation:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;First praise to God, the Giver of all
good, a Fountain of Compassion to His servants.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;From Haji Wan Muhammad, Teacher of His
Highness the Sultan of Perak, to the Resident who administers the
Government of Perak.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;The whole earth is in the hand of the Most
High God, and He gives it as an inheritance to whom He will of His
subjects. The true religion is also of God, and Heaven is the reward of
those who fear the Most High. Salvation and peace are for those
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb457" href="#pb457" name=
"pb457">457</a>]</span>who follow the straight path, and only they will
in the end arrive at real greatness. No Raja can do good, and none can
be powerful, except by the help of God, the Most High, who is also Most
Mighty.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;I make ten thousand salutations. I wish to
inquire about the practice of <i lang="ms">b&#277;r-hantu</i>, driving
oneself mad and losing one&rsquo;s reason, as has been the custom of
Rajas and Chiefs in this State of Perak; is it right, according to your
religion, Mr. Resident, or is it not? For that practice is a deadly sin
to the Muhammadan Faith, because those who engage in it lose their
reason and waste their substance for nothing; some of them cast it into
the water, while others scatter it broadcast through the jungle. How is
such conduct treated by your religion, Mr. Resident; is it right or
wrong? I want you in your indulgence to give me an answer, for this
practice is very hard on the poor. The Headmen collect from the
<i lang="ms">rayats</i>, and then they make elaborate preparations of
food, killing a buffalo or fowls, and all this is thrown away as
already stated. According to the Muhammadan religion such proceedings
lead to destruction.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;I salute you many times; do not be angry,
for I do not understand your customs, Mr. Resident.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following passage is an account of a
characteristic Malay dance, the Joget:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Malays are not dancers, but they pay professional
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=
"pb458">458</a>]</span>performers to dance for their amusement, and
consider that &lsquo;the better part&rsquo; is with those who watch, at
their ease, the exertions of a small class, whose members are not held
in the highest respect. The spectacle usually provided is strangely
wanting in attraction: a couple of women shuffling their feet and
swaying their hands in gestures that are practically devoid of grace or
even variety&mdash;that is the Malay dance&mdash;and it is accompanied
by the beating of native drums, the striking together of two short
sticks held in either hand, and the occasional boom of a metal gong.
The entertainment has an undoubted fascination for Malays, but it
generally forms part of a theatrical performance, and for Western
spectators it is immeasurably dull.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e24043src" href="#xd21e24043" name="xd21e24043src">150</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In one of the Malay States, however, P&#259;hang,
it has for years been the custom for the ruler and one or two of his
near relatives to keep trained dancing girls, who perform what is
called the &lsquo;J&ocirc;get&rsquo;&mdash;a real dance with an
accompaniment of something like real music, though the orchestral
instruments are very rude indeed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The dancers, <i lang="ms">b&ucirc;dak
j&ocirc;get</i>, belong to the Raja&rsquo;s household, they may even be
attached to him by a closer tie; they perform seldom, only for the
amusement of their lord and his friends, and the public are not
admitted. Years ago I saw such a dance,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e24056src" href="#xd21e24056" name="xd21e24056src">151</a> and
though peculiar to P&#259;hang, as far as the Malay States are
concerned, it is probable that it came originally from Java; the
instruments used by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href=
"#pb459" name="pb459">459</a>]</span>orchestra and the airs played are
certainly far more common in Java and Sumatra than in the
Peninsula.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I had gone to P&#259;hang on a political mission
accompanied by a friend, and we were vainly courting sleep in a
miserable lodging, when at 1 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> a message
came from the Sultan inviting us to witness a <i lang=
"ms">j&ocirc;get</i>. We accepted with alacrity, and at once made our
way to the <i lang="ms">ast&acirc;na</i>, a picturesque, well-built,
and commodious house on the right bank of the P&#259;hang river. A
palisade enclosed the courtyard, and the front of the house was a very
large hall, open on three sides, but covered by a lofty roof of
fantastic design supported on pillars. The floor of this hall was
approached by three wide steps continued round the three open sides,
the fourth being closed by a wooden wall which entirely shut off the
private apartments save for one central door over which hung a heavy
curtain. The three steps were to provide sitting accommodation
according to their rank for those admitted to the <i lang=
"ms">ast&acirc;na</i>. The middle of the floor on the night in question
was covered by a large carpet, chairs were placed for us, and the rest
of the guests sat on the steps of the dais.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When we entered, we saw, seated on the carpet,
four girls, two of them about eighteen and two about eleven years old,
all attractive according to Malay ideas of beauty, and all gorgeously
and picturesquely clothed. On their heads they each wore a large and
curious but very pretty ornament of delicate workmanship&mdash;a sort
of square flower garden where all the flowers were gold, trembling and
glittering with every movement of the wearer. These ornaments were
secured to the head by twisted cords of silver and gold. The
girls&rsquo; hair, combed down in a fringe, was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href="#pb460" name="pb460">460</a>]</span>cut
in a perfect oval round their foreheads and very becomingly dressed
behind.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The bodices of their dresses were made of
tight-fitting silk, leaving the neck and arms bare, whilst a white band
of fine cambric (about one and a half inches wide), passing round the
neck, came down on the front of the bodice in the form of a
<span class="xd21e24081">V</span>, and was there fastened by a golden
flower. Round their waists were belts fastened with large and
curiously-worked <i lang="ms">pinding</i> or buckles of gold, so large
that they reached quite across the waist. The rest of the costume
consisted of a skirt of cloth of gold (not at all like the <i lang=
"ms">s&acirc;rong</i>), reaching to the ankles, while a scarf of the
same material, fastened in its centre to the waist-buckle, hung down to
the hem of the skirt.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All four dancers were dressed alike, except that
the older girls wore white silk bodices with a red and gold
handkerchief, folded corner-wise, tied under the arms and knotted in
front. The points of the handkerchief hung to the middle of the back.
In the case of the two younger girls the entire dress was of one
material. On their arms the dancers wore numbers of gold bangles, and
their fingers were covered with diamond rings. In their ears were
fastened the diamond buttons so much affected by Malays, and indeed now
by Western ladies. Their feet, of course, were bare. We had ample time
to minutely observe these details before the dance commenced, for when
we came into the hall the four girls were sitting down in the
usual<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24092src" href="#xd21e24092" name=
"xd21e24092src">152</a> Eastern fashion on the carpet, bending forward,
their elbows resting on their thighs, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb461" href="#pb461" name="pb461">461</a>]</span>hiding the sides of
their faces, which were towards the audience, with fans made of crimson
and gilt paper which sparkled in the light.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On our entrance the band struck up, and our
special attention was called to the orchestra, as the instruments are
seldom seen in the Malay Peninsula. There were two chief performers:
one playing on a sort of harmonicon, the notes of which he struck with
pieces of stick held in each hand. The other, with similar pieces of
wood, played on inverted metal bowls. Both these performers seemed to
have sufficiently hard work, but they played with the greatest spirit
from 10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> till 5 <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The harmonicon is called by Malays <i lang=
"ms">ch&#277;lempong</i>, and the inverted bowls, which give a pleasant
and musical sound like the noise of rippling water, <i lang=
"ms">gambang</i>. The other members of the orchestra consisted of a
very small boy who played, with a very large and thick stick, on a
gigantic gong, an old woman who beat a drum with two sticks, and
several other boys who played on instruments like triangles called
<i lang="ms">ch&acirc;nang</i>. All these performers, we were told with
much solemnity, were artists of the first order, masters and a mistress
in their craft, and if vigour of execution counts for excellence they
proved the justice of the praise.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Hall, of considerable size, capable of
accommodating several hundreds of people, was only dimly lighted, but
the fact that, while the audience was in semi-darkness, the light was
concentrated on the performers added to the effect. Besides ourselves,
I question whether there were more than twenty spectators, but sitting
on the top of the dais, near to the dancers, it was hard to pierce the
surrounding gloom. The orchestra was placed on the left of the entrance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb462" href="#pb462" name=
"pb462">462</a>]</span>to the Hall, that is, rather to the side and
rather in the background, a position evidently chosen with due regard
to the feelings of the audience.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From the elaborate and vehement execution of the
players, and the want of regular time in the music, I judged, and
rightly, that we had entered as the overture began. During its
performance the dancers sat leaning forward, hiding their faces as I
have described; but when it concluded and, without any break, the music
changed into the regular rhythm for dancing, the four girls dropped
their fans, raised their hands in the act of <i lang=
"ms">S&#277;mbah</i> or homage, and then began the dance by swaying
their bodies and slowly waving their arms and hands in the most
graceful movements making much and effective use all the while of the
scarf hanging from their belts. Gradually raising themselves from a
sitting to a kneeling posture, acting in perfect accord in every
motion, then rising to their feet, they floated through a series of
figures hardly to be exceeded in grace and difficulty, considering that
the movements are essentially slow, the arms, hands, and body being the
real performers, whilst the feet are scarcely noticed and for half the
time not visible.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They danced five or six dances, each lasting
quite half an hour, with materially different figures and time in the
music. All these dances, I was told, were symbolical: one of
agriculture, with the tilling of the soil, the sowing of the seed, the
reaping and winnowing of the grain, might easily have been guessed from
the dancer&rsquo;s movements. But those of the audience whom I was near
enough to question were, Malay-like, unable to give me much
information. Attendants stood or sat near the dancers, and from time to
time, as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb463" href="#pb463" name=
"pb463">463</a>]</span>girls tossed one thing on the floor, handed them
another. Sometimes it was a fan or a mirror they held, sometimes a
flower or small vessel, but oftener their hands were empty, as it is in
the management of the fingers that the chief art of Malay dancers
consists.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The last dance, symbolical of war, was perhaps
the best, the music being much faster, almost inspiriting, and the
movements of the dancers more free and even abandoned. For the latter
half of the dance they each held a wand, to represent a sword, bound
with three rings of burnished gold which glittered in the light like
precious stones. This nautch, which began soberly like the others, grew
to a wild revel until the dancers were, or pretended to be, possessed
by the Spirit of Dancing, <i lang="ms">hantu m&#277;n&acirc;ri</i> as
they called it, and leaving the Hall for a moment to smear their
fingers and faces with a fragrant oil, they returned, and the two
eldest, striking at each other with their wands, seemed inclined to
turn the symbolical into a real battle. They were, however, after some
trouble, caught by four or five women and carried forcibly out of the
Hall, but not until their captors had been made to feel the weight of
the magic wands. The two younger girls, who looked as if they too would
like to be &ldquo;possessed,&rdquo; but did not know how to accomplish
it, were easily caught and removed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The bands, whose strains had been increasing in
wildness and in time, ceased playing on the removal of the dancers, and
the nautch, which had begun at 10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, was
over.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Raja, who had only appeared at 4 <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span>, told me that one of the elder girls, when she became
&ldquo;properly possessed,&rdquo; lived for months on nothing but
flowers, a pretty and poetic conceit.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As we left the Astana, and taking boat rowed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href="#pb464" name=

<p class="par">The religious origin of almost all Malay dances is still
to be seen in the performance of such ritualistic observances as the
burning of incense, the scattering of rice, and the invocation of the
Dance-spirit according to certain set forms, the spirit being duly
exorcised again (or &ldquo;escorted homewards,&rdquo; as it is called)
at the end of the performance.</p>
<p class="par">The dances which have best preserved the older ritual
are precisely those which are the least often seen, such as the
&ldquo;Gambor Dance&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">main gambor</i>), the
&ldquo;Monkey Dance&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">main b&rsquo;rok</i>), the
&ldquo;Palm-blossom Dance&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">main mayang</i>), and
the &ldquo;Fish-trap Dance&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">main lukah</i>). These
I will take in the order mentioned.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;Gambor Dance&rdquo; (lit. Gambor Play) should
be performed by girls just entering upon womanhood. The <i lang=
"fr">d&eacute;butante</i> is attired in an attractive coat and skirt
(<i lang="ms">sarong</i>), is girt about at the waist with a yellow
(royal) sash, and is further provided with an elaborate head-dress,
crescent-shaped pendants (<i lang="ms">dokoh</i>) for the breast, and a
fan. The only other &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; is the
&ldquo;Pleasure-garden&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">taman bunga</i>), which is
represented by a large water-jar containing a bunch of long sprays,
from the ends of which are made to depend artificial flowers, fruit,
and birds, the whole being intended to attract the spirit (Hantu
Gambor). In addition there is the usual circular tray, with its
complement of sacrificial rice and incense. Everything <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb465" href="#pb465" name=
"pb465">465</a>]</span>being ready, the <i lang=
"fr">d&eacute;butante</i> lies down and is covered over with a sheet,
and incense is burnt, the sacrificial rice sprinkled, and the
invocation of the spirit is chanted by a woman to the accompaniment of
the tambourines. Ere it has ended, if all goes well, the charm will
have begun to work, the spirit descends, and the dance commences.</p>
<p class="par">At the end of this dance, as has already been said, the
spirit is exorcised, that is, he is &ldquo;escorted back&rdquo; to the
seventh heaven from whence he came.</p>
<p class="par">The invocations, which are used both at the commencement
and the conclusion of the performance, consist of poems which belong
unmistakably to the &ldquo;Panji&rdquo; cycle of stories; here and
there they contain old words which are still used in Java.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;Monkey Dance&rdquo; is achieved by causing
the &ldquo;Monkey spirit&rdquo; to enter into a girl of some ten years
of age. She is first rocked to and fro in a Malay infant&rsquo;s
swinging-cot (<i lang="ms">buayan</i>), and fed with areca-nut and salt
(<i lang="ms">pinang garam</i>). When she is sufficiently dizzy or
&ldquo;dazed&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">mabok</i>), an invocation addressed
to the &ldquo;Monkey spirit&rdquo; is chanted (to tambourine
accompaniments), and at its close the child commences to perform a
dance, in the course of which she is said sometimes to achieve some
extraordinary climbing feats which she could never have achieved unless
&ldquo;possessed.&rdquo; When it is time for her to recover her senses
she is called upon by name, and if that fails to recall her, is bathed
all over with cocoa-nut milk (<i lang="ms">ayer niyor hijau</i>).</p>
<p class="par">The foregoing does not, of course, in any way exhaust
the list of Malay dances. Others will be found described in various
parts of this book, amongst them the &ldquo;Henna Dance&rdquo; (at
weddings); the medicine-man&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb466" href="#pb466" name="pb466">466</a>]</span>dance, as performed
at the bedside of a sick person; the dance performed in honour of a
dead tiger; theatrical dances, and many kinds of sword and dagger
dances, or posture-dances (such as the <i lang="ms">main
b&#277;rsilat</i>, or <i lang="ms">main b&#277;rp&#277;nchak</i>),
whether performed for the diversion of the beholders or by way of
defiance (as in war). The <i lang="ms">main dabus</i> is a dance
performed with a species of iron spits, whose upper ends are furnished
with hoops, upon which small iron rings are strung, and which
accordingly give out a jingling noise when shaken. Two of these spits
(<i lang="ms">buah dabus</i>) are charmed (to deaden their bite), and
taken up, one in each hand, by the dancer, who shakes them at each step
that he takes. When he is properly possessed, he drives the points of
these spits through the muscle of each forearm, and lets them hang down
whilst he takes up a second pair. He then keeps all four spits jingling
at once until the dance ceases. The point of each spit goes right
through the muscle, but if skilfully done, draws no blood.<a class=

<p class="par">We now come to a class of dances in which certain
inanimate objects, that are believed to be temporarily animated, are
the performers, and which therefore closely correspond to the
performances of our own spiritualists.</p>
<p class="par">The Palm-blossom dance is a very curious exhibition,
which I once saw performed in the Langat District of Selangor. Two
freshly-gathered sheaves of areca-palm blossom (each several feet in
length) were deposited upon a new mat, near a tray containing a censer
and the three kinds of sacrificial rice.</p>
<p class="par">The magician (&rsquo;Che Ganti by name) commenced the
performance by playing a prelude on his violin. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href="#pb467" name=
"pb467">467</a>]</span>Presently his wife (an aged Selangor woman) took
some of the rice in her hand and commenced to chant the words of the
invocation, she being almost immediately joined in the chant by a
younger woman. Starting with the words, &ldquo;Thus I brace up, I brace
up the Palm-blossom&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">&rsquo;ku anggit mayang
&rsquo;ku anggit</i>), their voices rose higher and higher until the
seventh stanza was reached, when the old woman covered the two sheaves
of Palm-blossom with a Malay plaid skirt (<i lang="ms">sarong</i>) and
the usual &ldquo;five cubits of white cloth&rdquo; (folded double),
both of which had of course first been fumigated. Then followed seven
more stanzas (&ldquo;Borrow the hammer, Borrow the anvil,&rdquo; and
its companion verses), and rice having been thrown over one of the
sheaves of palm-blossom, its sheath was opened and the contents
fumigated. Then the old woman took the newly-fumigated sheaf between
her hands, and the chant recommenced with the third septet of stanzas
(&ldquo;Dig up, dig up, the wild ginger plant&rdquo;), as the erect
palm-blossom swayed from side to side in time to the music. Finally the
fiddle stopped and tambourines were substituted, and at this point the
sheaf of blossom commenced to jump about on its stalk, as if it were
indeed possessed, and eventually dashed itself upon the ground. After
one or two repetitions of this performance, other persons present were
invited to try it, and did so with varying success, which depended, I
was told, upon the impressionability of their souls, as the
palm-blossom <i>would not dance for anybody whose soul was not
impressionable</i> (<span lang="ms">l&#277;mah
s&#277;mangat</span>).</p>
<p class="par">When the first blossom-sheaf had been destroyed by the
rough treatment which it had to undergo, the second was duly fumigated
and introduced to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb468" href=
"#pb468" name="pb468">468</a>]</span>company, and finally the
performance was brought to a close by the chanting of the stanzas in
which the spirit is requested to return to his own place. The two
spoiled sheaves of blossom were then carried respectfully out of the
house and laid on the ground beneath a banana-tree.</p>
<p class="par">The Dancing Fish-trap (<i lang="ms">main lukah</i>) is a
spiritualistic performance, in which a fish-trap (<i lang=
"ms">lukah</i>) is substituted for the sheaf of palm-blossom, and a
different invocation is used. In other respects there is very little
difference between the two. The fish-trap is dressed up much in the
same way as a &ldquo;scare-crow,&rdquo; so as to present a rough and
ready resemblance to the human figure, <i>i.e.</i> it is dressed in a
<i>woman&rsquo;s</i> coat and plaid skirt (<i lang="ms">sarong</i>),
both of which must, if possible, have been <i>worn</i> previously; a
stick is run through it to serve as the arms of the figure, and a
(sterile) cocoa-nut shell (<i lang="ms">t&#277;mpurong jantan</i>)
clapped on the top to serve as a head. The invocation is then chanted
in the same manner and to the same accompaniment as that used for the
&ldquo;Palm-blossom.&rdquo; At its conclusion the magician whispers, so
to speak, into the fish-trap&rsquo;s ear, bidding it &ldquo;not to
disgrace him,&rdquo; but rise up and dance, and the fish-trap presently
commences to rock to and fro, and to leap about in a manner which of
course proves it to be &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; by the spirit. Two
different specimens of the invocations used will be found in the
Appendix.</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Buffalo Fights and Cock Fights</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;The Malays are passionately addicted to
buffalo and cock fighting. Whole poems are devoted to enthusiastic
descriptions of these &lsquo;sports of princes,&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name="pb469">469</a>]</span>and
laws laid down for the latter as minute as those of the Hoyleian
code.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24326src" href="#xd21e24326"
name="xd21e24326src">155</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The bulls have been trained and medicined for
months beforehand, with much careful tending, many strength-giving
potions, and volumes of the old-world charms, which put valour and
courage into a beast. They stand at each end of a piece of grassy lawn,
with their knots of admirers around them, descanting on their various
points, and with the proud trainer, who is at once keeper and
medicine-man, holding them by the cord which is passed through their
nose-rings. Until you have seen the water-buffalo stripped for the
fight, it is impossible to conceive how handsome the ugly brute can
look. One has been accustomed to see him with his neck bowed to the
yoke he hates, and breaks whenever the opportunity offers; or else in
the <i lang="ms">p&acirc;di</i> fields. In the former case he looks out
of place,&mdash;an anachronism belonging to a prehistoric period,
drawing a cart which seems also to date back to the days before the
Deluge. In the fields the buffalo has usually a complete suit of grey
mud, and during the quiet evening hour goggles at you through the
clouds of flies which surround his flapping ears and brutal nose, the
only parts that can be seen of him above the surface of the mud-hole or
the running water of the river. In both cases he is unlovely, but in
the bull-ring he has something magnificent about him. His black coat
has a gloss upon it which would not disgrace a London carriage horse,
and which shows him to be in tip-top condition. His neck seems thicker
and more powerful than that of any other animal, and it glistens with
the <i>chili</i> water, which has been poured over it in order to
increase his excitement. His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href=
"#pb470" name="pb470">470</a>]</span>resolute shoulders, his straining
quarters,&mdash;each vying with the other for the prize for
strength,&mdash;and his great girth, give a look of astonishing vigour
and vitality to the animal. It is the head of the buffalo, however,
which it is best to look at on these occasions. Its great spread of
horns is very imposing, and the eyes, which are usually sleepy,
cynically contemptuous and indifferent, or sullenly cruel, are for once
full of life, anger, passion, and excitement. He stands there quivering
and stamping, blowing great clouds of smoke from his mouth and
nose:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the
brim,</p>
<p class="line">And with circles of red for his eye-socket&rsquo;s
rim.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">&ldquo;The wild joy of battle is sending the blood
boiling through the great arteries of the beast, and his accustomed
lethargic existence is galvanised into a new fierce life. You can see
that he is longing for the battle with an ardour that would have
distanced that of a Quixote, and, for the first time, you begin to see
something to admire even in the water-buffalo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A crowd of <i>R&acirc;jas</i>, Chiefs, and
commoners are assembled, in their gaily-coloured garments, which always
serve to give life and beauty to every Malay picture, with its setting
of brilliant never-fading green. The women in their gaudy silks, and
dainty veils, glance coquettishly from behind the fenced enclosure
which has been prepared for their protection, and where they are quite
safe from injury. The young <i>R&acirc;jas</i> stalk about, examine the
bulls, and give loud and contradictory orders as to the manner in which
the fight is to be conducted. The keepers, fortunately, are so deafened
by the row which every one near them is making, that they are utterly
incapable of following <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href=
"#pb471" name="pb471">471</a>]</span>directions which they cannot hear.
Malays love many people and many things, and one of the latter is the
sound of their own voices. When they are excited&mdash;and in the
bull-ring they are always wild with excitement&mdash;they wax very
noisy indeed, and, as they all talk, and no one listens to what any one
else is saying, the green sward on which the combat is to take place
speedily becomes a pandemonium, compared with which the Tower of Babel
was a quiet corner in Sleepy Hollow.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At last the word to begin is given, and the
keepers of the buffaloes let out the lines made fast to the
bulls&rsquo; noses, and lead their charges to the centre of the green.
The lines are crossed, and then gradually drawn taut, so that the bulls
are soon facing one another. Then the knots are loosed, and the cords
slip from the nose-rings. A dead silence falls upon the people, and for
a moment the combatants eye one another. Then they rush together,
forehead to forehead, with a mighty impact. A fresh roar rends the sky,
the backers of each beast shrieking advice and encouragement to the
bull which carries their money.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;After the first rush, the bulls no longer charge,
but stand with interlaced horns, straining shoulders, and quivering
quarters, bringing tremendous pressure to bear one upon the other,
while each strives to get a grip with the point of its horns upon the
neck, or cheeks, or face of its opponent. A buffalo&rsquo;s horn is not
sharp, but the weight of the animal is enormous, and you must remember
that the horns are driven with the whole of the brute&rsquo;s bulk for
lever and sledgehammer. Such force as is exerted would be almost
sufficient to push a crowbar through a stone wall, and, tough though
they are, the hardest of old bull buffaloes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb472" href="#pb472" name="pb472">472</a>]</span>is
not proof against the terrible pressure brought to bear. The bulls show
wonderful activity and skill in these fencing matches. Each beast gives
way the instant that it is warned by the touch of the horn-tip that its
opponent has found an opening, and woe betide the bull that puts its
weight into a stab which the other has time to elude. In the flick of
an eye&mdash;as the Malay phrase has it&mdash;advantage is taken of the
blunder, and, before the bull has time to recover its lost balance, its
opponent has found an opening, and has wedged its horn-point into the
neck or cheek. When at last a firm grip has been won, and the horn has
been driven into the yielding flesh, as far as the struggles of its
opponent render possible, the stabber makes his great effort. Pulling
his hind-legs well under him, and straightening his fore-legs to the
utmost extent, till the skin is drawn taut over the projecting bosses
of bone at the shoulders, and the knots of muscle stand out like
cordage on a crate, he lifts his opponent. His head is skewed on one
side, so that the horn on which his adversary is hooked is raised to
the highest level possible, and his massive neck strains and quivers
with the tremendous effort. If the stab is sufficiently low down, say
in the neck or under the cheek-bone, the wounded bull is often lifted
clean off his fore-feet, and hangs there helpless and motionless
&lsquo;while a man might count a score.&rsquo; The exertion of lifting,
however, is too great to admit of its being continued for any length of
time, and as soon as the wounded buffalo regains its power of
motion&mdash;that is to say, as soon as its fore-feet are again on the
ground&mdash;it speedily releases itself from its adversary&rsquo;s
horn. Then, since the latter is often spent by the extraordinary effort
which has been made, it frequently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb473"
href="#pb473" name="pb473">473</a>]</span>happens that it is stabbed
and lifted in its turn before balance has been completely
recovered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Once, and only once, have I seen a bull succeed
in throwing his opponent, after he had lifted it off its feet. The
vanquished bull turned over on its back before it succeeded in
regaining its feet, but the victor was itself too used up to more than
make a ghost of a stab at the exposed stomach of its adversary. This
throw is still spoken of in Pahang as the most marvellous example of
skill and strength which has ever been called forth within living
memory by any of these contests.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As the stabs follow one another, to the sound of
the clicking of the horns and the mighty blowing and snorting of the
breathless bulls, lift succeeds lift with amazing rapidity. The green
turf is stamped into mud by the great hoofs of the labouring brutes,
and at length one bull owns himself to be beaten. Down goes his
head&mdash;that sure sign of exhaustion&mdash;and in a moment he has
turned round and is off on a bee-line, hotly pursued by the victor. The
chase is never a long one, as the conqueror always abandons it at the
end of a few hundred yards, but while it lasts it is fast and furious,
and woe betide the man who finds himself in the way of either of the
excited animals.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mr. Kipling has told us all about the Law of the
Jungle&mdash;which after all is only the code of man, adapted to the
use of the beasts by Mr. Rudyard Kipling&mdash;but those who know the
ways of buffaloes are aware that they possess one very well-recognised
law. This is, &lsquo;Thou shalt not commit trespass.&rsquo; Every
buffalo-bull has its own ground; and into this no other bull willingly
comes. If he is brought there to do battle, he fights with very little
heart, and is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href="#pb474" name=
"pb474">474</a>]</span>easily vanquished by an opponent of half his
strength and bulk who happens to be fighting on his own land. When
bulls are equally matched, they are taken to fight on neutral ground.
When they are badly matched the land owned by the weaker is selected
for the scene of the contest.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All these fights are brutal, and in time they
will, we trust, be made illegal. To pass a prohibitionary regulation,
however, without the full consent of the Chiefs and people of Pahang
would be a distinct breach of the understanding on which British
Protection was accepted by them. The Government is pledged not to
interfere with native customs, and the sports in which animals are
engaged are among the most cherished institutions of the people of
Pahang. To fully appreciate the light in which any interference with
these things would be viewed by the native population, it is necessary
to put oneself in the position of a keen member of the Quorn, who saw
Parliament making hunting illegal, on the grounds that the sufferings
inflicted on the fox rendered it an inhuman pastime. As I have said in
a former chapter, the natives of Pahang are, in their own way, very
keen sportsmen indeed; and, when all is said and done, it is doubtful
whether hunting is not more cruel than anything which takes place in a
Malay cock-pit or bull-ring. The longer the run the better the sport,
and more intense and prolonged the agony of the fox, that strives to
run for his life, even when he is so stiff with exertion that he can do
little more than roll along. All of us have, at one time or another,
experienced in nightmares the agony of attempting to fly from some
pursuing phantom, when our limbs refuse to serve us. This, I fancy, is
much what a fox <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475"
name="pb475">475</a>]</span>suffers, only his pains are intensified by
the grimness of stern reality. If he stops he loses his life, therefore
he rolls, and flounders, and creeps along when every movement has
become a fresh torture. The cock, quail, dove, bull, ram, or
fish,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24380src" href="#xd21e24380" name=
"xd21e24380src">156</a> on the other hand, fights because it is his
nature to do so, and when he has had his fill he stops. His pluck, his
pride, and his hatred of defeat alone urge him to continue the contest.
He is never driven by the relentless whip of stern, inexorable
necessity. This it is which makes fights between animals, that are
properly conducted, less cruel than one is apt to
imagine.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24386src" href="#xd21e24386"

<p class="par">&ldquo;In the Archipelago, and on the West Coast of the
Peninsula, cock-fights are conducted in the manner known to the Malays
as <i lang="ms">b&#277;r-t&acirc;ji</i>, the birds being armed with
long artificial spurs, sharp as razors, and curved like a Malay
woman&rsquo;s eyebrow. These weapons make cruel wounds, and cause the
death of one or other of the combatants almost before the sport has
well begun. To the Malay of the East Coast this form of cock-fighting
is regarded as stupid and unsportsmanlike, an opinion which I fully
share. It is the marvellous pluck and endurance of the birds that lend
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name=
"pb476">476</a>]</span>an interest to a cock-fight&mdash;qualities
which are in no way required if the birds are armed with weapons other
than those with which they are furnished by nature.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A cock-fight between two well-known birds is a
serious affair in Pahang. The rival qualities of the combatants have
furnished food for endless discussion for weeks, or even months,
before, and every one of standing has visited and examined the cocks,
and has made a book upon the event. On the day fixed for the fight a
crowd collects before the palace, and some of the King&rsquo;s youths
set up the cock-pit, which is a ring, about three feet in diameter,
enclosed by canvas walls, supported on stakes driven into the ground.
Presently the <i lang="ms">Ju&acirc;ra</i>, or cock-fighters, appear,
each carrying his bird under his left arm. They enter the cock-pit,
squat down, and begin pulling at, and shampooing the legs and wings of
their birds, in the manner which Malays believe loosen the muscles, and
get the reefs out of the cocks&rsquo; limbs. Then the word is given to
start the fight, and the birds, released, fly straight at one another,
striking with their spurs, and sending feathers flying in all
directions. This lasts for perhaps three minutes, when the cocks begin
to lose their wind, and the fight is carried on as much with their
beaks as with their spurs. Each bird tries to get its head under its
opponent&rsquo;s wing, running forward to strike at the back of its
antagonist&rsquo;s head, as soon as its own emerges from under its
temporary shelter. This is varied by an occasional blow with the spurs,
and the Malays herald each stroke with loud cries of approval. <i lang=

floating on the surface of a jar of water, until it gradually becomes
filled and sinks. At the word, each cock-fighter seizes his bird,
drenches it with water, cleans out with a feather the phlegm which has
collected in its throat, and shampoos its legs and body. Then, at the
given word, the birds are again released, and they fly at one another
with renewed energy. They lose their wind more speedily this time, and
thereafter they pursue the tactics already described until time is
again called. When some ten rounds have been fought, and both the birds
are beginning to show signs of distress, the interest of the contest
reaches its height, for the fight is at an end if either bird raises
its back feathers in a peculiar manner, by which cocks declare
themselves to be vanquished. Early in the tenth round the right
eye-ball of one cock is broken, and, shortly after, the left eye is
bunged up, so that for the time it is blind. Nevertheless, it refuses
to throw up the sponge, and fights on gallantly to the end of the
round, taking terrible punishment, and doing but little harm to its
opponent. One cannot but be full of pity and admiration for the brave
bird, which thus gives so marvellous an example of its pluck and
endurance. At last time is called, and the cock-fighter who is in
charge of the blinded bird, after examining it carefully, asks for a
needle and thread, and the swollen lower lid of the still uninjured
eye-ball is sewn to the piece of membrane on the bird&rsquo;s cheek,
and its sight is thus once more partially restored. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb478" href="#pb478" name=
"pb478">478</a>]</span>Again time is called, and the birds resume their
contest, the cock with the injured eye repaying its adversary so
handsomely for the punishment which it had received in the previous
round, that, before the cocoa-nut shell is half full of water, its
opponent has surrendered, and has immediately been snatched up by the
keeper in charge of it. The victorious bird, draggled and woebegone,
with great patches of red flesh showing through its wet plumage, with
the membrane of its face and its short gills and comb swollen and
bloody, with one eye put out, and the other only kept open by the
thread attached to its eyelid, yet makes shift to strut, with
staggering gait, across the cock-pit, and to notify its victory by
giving vent to a lamentable ghost of a crow. Then it is carried off
followed by an admiring, gesticulating, vociferous crowd, to be
elaborately tended and nursed, as befits so gallant a bird. The beauty
of the sport is that either bird can stop fighting at any moment. They
are never forced to continue the conflict if once they have declared
themselves defeated, and the only real element of cruelty is thus
removed. The birds in fighting follow the instinct which nature has
implanted in them, and their marvellous courage and endurance surpass
anything to be found in any other animals, human or otherwise, with
which I am acquainted. Most birds fight more or less&mdash;from the
little fierce quail to the sucking doves which ignorant Europeans,
before their illusions have been dispelled by a sojourn in the East,
are accustomed to regard as the emblems of peace and purity; but no
bird, or beast, or fish, or human being fights so well, or takes such
pleasure in the fierce joy of battle, as does a plucky, lanky, ugly,
hard-bit old fighting-cock. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb479" href=

the head so that he died.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;That will teach my people to have a care
how they use my fighting-cocks!&rsquo; said the <i lang=

<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;It is a mere boyish prank,&rsquo; said the

reported to him, &lsquo;and, moreover, it is well that he should slay
one or two with his own hand, else how should men learn to fear

<p class="par">&ldquo;There are two kinds of spurs: first, the Golok
Golok, in the form of a straight knife known by this name and in use
with the Malays; and, secondly, the Taji Benkok, or curved spur: the
last is most in vogue.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are various modes of tying on the spur,
viz. Salik, or below the natural spur; Kumbar, on a level with it;
Panggong, above the spur; Sa ibu Tangan, a thumb&rsquo;s breadth below

Bulu, close to the feathers under the knee; Jankir, upon the little

the spur; Golok di Battang, below the natural spur. It is necessary to
observe that the Malays generally use one spur; though two spurs are
sometimes given to match a weaker against a stronger bird.</p>

<p class="par">&ldquo;The Malays believe in the influence of certain
periods in the day over the breeds of cocks. They will not bet upon a
bird with black plumage that is matched against one with yellow and

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb482" href="#pb482" name=

<p class="par">&ldquo;I once witnessed a grand contest between two
Malayan States at the breaking up of the Ramazan fast. Most of the
cock-fighters presented themselves at the Golongan or cock-pit with a
game-cock under each arm. The birds were not trimmed as in England, but
fought in full feather. The spurs used on this occasion were about two
and a half inches long, in shape like the blade of a scythe, and were
sharpened on the spot by means of a fine whetstone; large gashes were
inflicted by these murderous instruments, and it rarely happened that
both cocks survived the battle. Cocks of the same colour are seldom
matched. The weight is adjusted by the setters-to passing them to and
from each other&rsquo;s hands as they sit facing each other in the
Golongan. Should there be any difference, it is brought down to an
equality by the spur being fixed so many scales higher on the leg of
the heavier cock, or according to rules adverted to, as deemed fair by
both parties. One spur only is used, and is generally fastened near the
natural spur on the inside of the left leg. In adjusting these
preliminaries the professional skill of the setters-to is called into
action, and much time is taken up in grave deliberation, which often
terminates in wrangling. The birds, after various methods of irritating
them have been practised, are then set to. During the continuance of
the battle, the excitement and interest taken by the Malays in the
barbarous exhibition is vividly depicted in their <span class=

football, played by ten or twenty youths and men, who stand in a
circle, keeping up a hollow ratan ball in the air, which is passed to

prevent the ball from touching the ground; it is frequently, however,
taken at the rebound. The awkwardness of novices occasions great
merriment.</p>

two Sukus or tribes. A certain number of men from each tribe turn out
and pelt each other with sticks and logs of wood, until one of the
parties gives in. The victors in this petty tourney are presumed to
have the right on their side.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Malays are remarkably attached to singing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484" name=

alternate rhyming lines, of which notice has been taken elsewhere.
Poetical contests in the Bucolic style are often carried on to a great
length by means of Pantuns. To music Malays are passionately devoted,
particularly to that of the violin. They evince a good ear, and great
readiness in committing to memory even European airs. A voyage or
journey of any length is seldom undertaken by the better classes
without a minstrel.</p>

<p class="par">Of all minor games, top-spinning and kite-flying are
perhaps the most popular. The kites are called <i lang=
"ms">layang-layang</i>, which means a &ldquo;swallow,&rdquo; but are
sometimes of great size, one which was brought to me at Langat
measuring some six feet in height by about seven feet between the tips
of the wings. The peculiarity of the Malay kite is that it presents a
convex, instead of a concave, surface to the wind, and that no
&ldquo;tail&rdquo; is required, the kite being steadied by means of a
beak which projects forward at the top of the framework. They are also
usually provided with a thin, horizontal slip of bamboo (<i lang=
"ms">d&#277;ngong</i>) stretched tightly behind the beak, and which
hums loudly in the wind. They are of a great number of different but
well-recognised patterns, such as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb485" href="#pb485" name="pb485">485</a>]</span>&ldquo;Fighting
Dragons&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">Naga b&#277;rjuang</i>), the Crescent
(<i lang="ms">Sahari bulan</i>), the Eagle (<i lang="ms">Rajawali</i>),
the Bird of Paradise (<i lang="ms">Ch&#277;ndrawasih</i>), and so
forth. A small kind of roughly-made kite is, as is well known, used at
Singapore for fishing purposes, but I have never yet met with any
instance of their being used ceremonially, though it is quite certain
that grown-ups will fly them with quite as much zest as children.</p>
<p class="par">Top-spinning, again, is a favourite pastime among the
Malays, and is played by old and young of all ranks with the same
eagerness.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e24640src" href="#xd21e24640"
name="xd21e24640src">170</a> The most usual form of top is not unlike
the English pegtop, but has a shorter peg. It is spun in the same way
and with the same object as our own pegtop, the object being to split
the top of one&rsquo;s opponent.</p>
<p class="par">Teetotums are also used, and I have seen in Selangor a
species of bamboo humming-top, but was told that it was copied from a
humming-top used by the Chinese.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The game of chess, which has been introduced from

as among Europeans, but the queen, instead of being placed upon her own
colour, is stationed at the right hand of the king. In the Malay game
the king, if he has not been checked, can be castled, but over one
space only, not over two, as in the English game. The king may, also,
before he is checked or moved from his own square, move once, like a
knight, either to left or right, and he may also, if he has not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name=

boat-shaped block.</p>
<p class="par">In the top of this block (where the boat&rsquo;s deck
would be) are sunk a double row of holes, the rows containing eight
holes each, and two more holes are added, one at each end. Each of the
eight holes (in both rows) is filled at starting with eight <i lang=
"ms">buah gorek</i> (the <i lang="ms">buah gorek</i> being the fruit of
a common tree, also called <i lang="ms">k&#277;lichi</i> in Malacca).
There are usually two players who pick the <i lang="ms">buah gorek</i>
out of the holes in turn, and deposit them in the next hole according
to certain fixed rules of numerical combination, a solitary <i lang=
"ms">buah gorek</i>, wherever it is found, being put back and compelled
to recommence its journey down the board.</p>
<p class="par">A similar game is, I believe, known in many parts of the
East, and was formerly much played even by Malay slaves, who used to
make the double row of holes in the ground when no board was
obtainable.</p>
<p class="par">The Malay game of Draughts (<i lang="ms">main dam</i>)

<p class="par">&ldquo;A player does not hastily look at his three cards
and learn his fate at once, but he prolongs the excitement by holding
his cards tight together, and looking alternately at the outside ones,

two others little by little. Thus it is left uncertain for some time
whether a card is an eight or a seven, a nine or a ten.</p>

it is going to be an eight, or at all events a seven (three pips on

<p class="par">The three most important card games are&mdash;(1)
<i lang="ms">main sakopong</i>, (2) <i lang="ms">main chabut</i>, (3)
<i lang="ms">main tiga &rsquo;lei</i>, or <i lang="ms">pakau</i>.</p>
<p class="par">1. In the game called <i lang="ms">sakopong</i> all
cards from two to six are cast out, and five cards are dealt out to
each of the players (who may be from two to four in number); a player
leads (<i lang="ms">turunkan</i>) the card, and the next player has
either to follow suit (<i lang="ms">turunkan daun sagaji</i>) or throw
down a card, turning it over (<i lang="ms">susupkan</i>). If the next
player is able to follow suit, whoever plays the highest card of the
suit wins. If each player wins a trick it is declared drawn (<i lang=
"ms">s&rsquo;ri</i>), and in this case all stakes are returned.</p>
<p class="par">2. <i lang="ms">Main chabut</i> is a species of
vingt-et-un, and is played with either twenty-one or thirty-one points.
If twenty-one points only is the game, court-cards are not counted; but
if the game is thirty-one points they are also added in. Two cards are
dealt by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491" name=
"pb491">491</a>]</span>the dealer (<i lang="ms">p&#277;rdi</i>) to each
player, who draws (<i lang="ms">chabut</i>) fresh cards from the bottom
of the pack in his turn, and gets as near as possible to thirty-one. If
he thinks he cannot safely draw another card (<i>e.g.</i> after
twenty-six pips are in his hand) he &ldquo;passes&rdquo; (which is
called <i lang="ms">b&rsquo;lit k&#277;chil</i> if he stops at
twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight, and <i lang="ms">b&rsquo;lit
b&#277;sar</i> if he stops at twenty-nine or thirty).</p>
<p class="par">If he obtains exactly thirty-one pips he is said to
&ldquo;enter the points&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">masok mata</i>); but no
player can draw more than seven cards, and if he has, after drawing to
the full limit, still failed to obtain as many pips as he wants, he is
said to &ldquo;enter the pack&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">masok daun</i>). I
may add that the first two cards are called lunas or
&ldquo;keels,&rdquo; and this may be of various kinds,
<i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. <i lang="ms">Lunas nikah</i>, i.e. <i lang="ms">angkong
d&#277;ngan sat</i> (a court-card and an ace).</li>
<li>2. <i lang="ms">Kachang di-rendang di-tugalkan</i>, i.e. two aces;
a very convenient hand, as the aces may be reckoned as either one or
eleven, as occasion may require.</li>
<li>3. <i lang="ms">Lunas sa-glabat</i>, or <i lang="ms">sagaji
ampat-b&rsquo;las</i>, i.e. <i lang="ms">angkong d&#277;ngan daun
ampat</i> (court-card and four).</li>
<li>4. <i lang="ms">Lunas dua jalor</i>, two threes.</li>
<li>5. Ace and two, which is the best of all.</li>
</ul>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In playing <i lang="ms">chabut</i> or &ldquo;casting
out,&rdquo; the tens should be thrown away (<i lang="ms">di-buang daun
puloh</i>). When two players have the same number of
pips&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> nine and nine or eight and eight&mdash;the
coincidence is described in the words, <i lang="ms">Jumpa di jalan,
di-adu, kalah, di-chabut, mati</i>. To be &ldquo;bluffed&rdquo; is
called <i lang="ms">k&#277;na ranjau</i> (wounded by a caltrop).</p>
<p class="par">And again, when a player has obtained, let us say,
twenty-six pips with six cards, and so has only one more chance, and is
afraid to risk it, his position is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492"
href="#pb492" name="pb492">492</a>]</span>ridiculed in the phrase,
<i lang="ms">Sa-nepak Ulu Klang</i>, a jest of obviously local
coinage.</p>
<p class="par">The phrase <i lang="ms">T&#277;ngah tiang</i> (half
mast), again, is applied to twenty-five pips held irrespective of the
number of cards; and if more than thirty-one are obtained, the player
is said to be out (<i lang="ms">mati</i>, or <i lang="ms">masok
piring</i>).</p>
<p class="par">3. <i lang="ms">Daun tiga &rsquo;lei</i> or <i lang=
"ms">Pakau</i> is played here as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Three cards are dealt by the dealer to each player, and
the winner is he who holds the greatest number of pips, with certain
exceptions.</p>

<p class="par">A hand of three threes, it will be observed, is the
second best hand in Selangor, whereas in Perak, according to Sir W. E.
Maxwell, it is thrown away as the worst.</p>
<p class="par">The stakes, which are deposited in two heaps by each
player, are here called <i lang="ms">kapala</i> or &ldquo;head,&rdquo;
and <i lang="ms">buntut</i> (or <i lang="ms">ekor</i>), the
&ldquo;tail,&rdquo; respectively; the <i lang="ms">kapala</i> being
generally, though perhaps not always, greater than the <i lang=
"ms">ekor</i> in Selangor, instead of the reverse. The latter can only
be lost when a player sweeps the board. A single stake, again, is
<i lang="ms">podul</i> (or occasionally <i lang="ms">tual</i>), but
<i lang="ms">b&#277;rtuwi</i> is applied to betting between players,
and <i lang="ms">sorong</i> or <i lang="ms">tokong</i> means to put
down a stake before your rival replies with a counter-stake
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name=
"pb493">493</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">b&#277;rteban</i> or <i lang=
"ms">topah</i>). A player who holds thirty exactly is not out
here&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, he may hold a court-card and two tens. To look
at the bottom card is <i lang="ms">m&#277;nengo&rsquo;
angkatan</i>.</p>
<p class="par">Sir W. E. Maxwell gives a number of names and phrases
applied to particular cards and combinations of cards, to which I may
add&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Two nines and a two&mdash;<i lang="ms">China Keh m&#277;ngandar
ayer</i>.</li>
<li>An eight and an ace (making nine) with a court-card, or a ten and
two nines&mdash;<i lang="ms">S&#277;mbilang
b&#277;rt&#277;lor</i>.</li>
<li>Two court-cards and a nine&mdash;<i lang="ms">Parak hari &rsquo;nak
siang</i>.</li>
<li>The four of any suit&mdash;<i lang="ms">Tiang jamban L&#277;bai
&#703;Ali</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The explanation of <i lang="ms">handak kaki tiga</i>, as
applied to an eight, appears to be that the eight has three pips on
each side. It is also called <i lang="ms">b&#277;risi
sa-b&rsquo;lah</i>. <i lang="ms">Minta&rsquo; p&#277;noh</i> (I ask for
a full one) means I want a nine (?), and <i lang="ms">minta&rsquo;
tombak</i> (I ask for a lance), I want two pips (or three, as the case
may be).</p>
<p class="par">Besides the above, there are miniature or bijou cards
(<i lang="ms">ch&#277;ki</i>)&mdash;e.g. <i lang="ms">ch&#277;ki
dua-b&rsquo;las</i>, <i lang="ms">ch&#277;ki lima-b&rsquo;las</i> and
<i lang="ms">&rsquo;tan</i> or <i lang="ms">b&#277;r&#277;tan daun
sambilan</i>, etc., the <i lang="ms">daun ch&#277;ki</i> being
distinguished by their borders, e.g. <i lang="ms">iyu kuching</i>,
<i lang="ms">iyu nyonya</i>, <i lang="ms">iyu panjang</i>, <i lang=
"ms">iyu m&#277;rak besar</i>, <i lang="ms">iyu kasut</i>; and again
<i lang="ms">gapet</i>, <i lang="ms">gapet k&rsquo;rang</i>, <i lang=

"ms">layer</i>, <i lang="ms">layer rintek</i>, <i lang="ms">layer
pitis</i>, <i lang="ms">layer lichin</i>. Six to seven people play
these games. A sort of whist is also played from time to time under the
name of <i lang="ms">main trup</i>. At this game a trick is called
<i lang="ms">sapudi</i>; to sweep the board is <i lang="ms">pukol
tani</i>; and the players who get no tricks at all are said to be sold
up (<i lang="ms">k&#277;na kot</i>).<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par first">I will now give some specimens of the games I have
seen played by children:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Throwing the Flower across&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">champak bunga sa-b&rsquo;lah</i>) is a game which I have seen thus
played by boys.</p>
<p class="par">A handkerchief was twisted up (like a rope) from corner
to corner, folded in half, and then tied together at the ends.</p>
<p class="par">Two couples stood facing one another at a few
yards&rsquo; distance, and at a given signal one of the boys in each
couple took his companion up on to his shoulders. The two who were
mounted threw the handkerchief across to each other, and back again by
turns. When the one failed to catch it, both riders dismounted and
offered backs to their late &ldquo;mounts,&rdquo; who thus became
riders, and threw the handkerchief in their turn. Each time, however,
that a catch was made both parties crossed over. When three catches
were made in unbroken succession (<i lang="ms">k&#277;lerik</i>) the
riders had the privilege of being carried across three times before
recommencing play.</p>
<p class="par">I should add that a coin was tossed up at the outset of
the game to decide who were to start as the riders, and who were to be
the ridden.</p>
<p class="par"><i lang="ms">Main Sesel</i> (or <i lang="ms">Kachau
kueh</i>) bears a strong family resemblance to our own &ldquo;Hen and
chickens.&rdquo; When I witnessed it, a big boy played the
&ldquo;Paterfamilias&rdquo; with a string of children at his back, each
of whom was holding on to the one in front of him. Presently a
&ldquo;Cakeseller&rdquo; presented himself, and the following
conversation ensued:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href=
"#pb495" name="pb495">495</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first"><span class="sc">Paterfamilias</span>: <i lang=

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">C.: <i lang="ms">Buleh.</i> (Yes.)</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Here the Cakeseller hands a ball of earth to
Paterfamilias, who passes it down the line of children to the youngest
child at the end of the row. The conversation then
recommenced&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first"><span class="sc">Cakeseller</span>: <i lang=

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Here a desperate effort was made by the poor Cakeseller
to dodge past Paterfamilias and get at the boy, whom he eventually
succeeded in carrying off.</p>
<p class="par"><i lang="ms">Main Tul</i> is a game somewhat resembling
our own &ldquo;Puss in the corner,&rdquo; but with only one
&ldquo;home.&rdquo; The &ldquo;home&rdquo; consisted of a stake planted
upright, and the first &ldquo;Puss&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">orang tul</i>)
was selected by a species of divination depending upon repetition of
the same formula as is used to select the blind man in Blind
Man&rsquo;s Buff (<i lang="ms">Main China Buta</i>). There was (as I
have said) only one home in this game, from which the players sallied
forth to taunt the <i lang="ms">orang tul</i>, and which they were
obliged to touch in order to save themselves when closely pursued.</p>
<p class="par"><i lang="ms">Main S&#277;ladang</i> (Wild Bull game) is
an excellent game for children with the shoeless feet of the East. A
&ldquo;wild bull&rdquo; having been selected by repetition of the
<i lang="ms">Ping hilang</i> formula, went upon all fours, and entered
into the following conversation between himself and one of the other
players specially selected for the purpose. The latter opened
negotiations with the clearly non-committal, if not very lucid remark,
&ldquo;<i lang="ms">Tam <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href=

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The Bull at the end of this baiting was ready to
&ldquo;charge&rdquo; anybody and everything, and did accordingly run at
the rest of the players, kicking out with all his might at anybody who
came near. As he had to move on all fours he could not go very fast,
and the other players took advantage of this to bait him still further
by slapping him on the back and jumping over him. Whenever they came
near enough he lashed out with his heels, and when he succeeded in
kicking another player below the knee, the latter became a Bull in his
turn. Much agility is displayed in this game, which is thoroughly
enjoyed by the players.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Blind Man&rsquo;s Buff&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">Main
China Buta</i>, or &ldquo;Blind Chinaman&rdquo;) is played in exactly
the same manner as our own Blind Man&rsquo;s Buff; one of the party,
with bandaged eyes, being required to catch any one who comes near
him.</p>
<p class="par">The first blind man&mdash;at the commencement of the
game&mdash;is chosen as follows: the intending players sit down
together in a close circle, each of them putting down the tips of their

Malays, and are now quite &ldquo;naturalised&rdquo; in the Peninsula,
it is pretty clear that the greater part have been borrowed from India,
Siam, China, and possibly other countries. It is noteworthy that many,
perhaps most, of the plots represented in these performances
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb504" href="#pb504" name=
"pb504">504</a>]</span>owe their origin to the old classical Indian
Epics, and especially to the story of the Ramayana, which has been
handed down traditionally, much modified by local colouring, in Java
and Siam as well as in the Malay Peninsula.</p>
<p class="par">It is not within the scope of this work to give anything
like a full description of these different kinds of dramatic
representations, but it is desirable to give some account of the ritual
which accompanies them, and the ideas and superstitions which they seem
to involve.</p>
<p class="par">The most important of the ceremonies which relate to the
Malay theatre is that of inaugurating or &ldquo;opening&rdquo; (as it
is called) a site for the performance. The following is an account (by
Mr. Hugh Clifford) of the performance of this ceremony:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When one of these companies arrives at a place
where it intends to &lsquo;open,&rsquo; it erects a small, square shed,
open at all four sides, but carefully roofed in, and with a hand-rail
running round it about two feet from the ground. This shed is called a
<i lang="ms">Bangsal</i>, and the space which its sides enclose is
termed <i lang="ms">Panggong</i>. Before the play begins, the ceremony
called <i lang="ms">B&ucirc;ka Panggong</i>, which has for its object
the invocation and propitiation of certain spirits, is gone
through....</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The ceremony, which is a curious one, is
performed in the following manner: The company having entered the shed
and taken their seats, a brazier is placed in front of the <i lang=
"ms">P&acirc;wang</i>, or Medicine-Man, who is also the head of the
theatrical troop. In this brazier precious woods and spices are burned,
and while the incense ascends, the <i lang="ms">P&acirc;wang</i>
intones the following incantation, the other members of the troop
repeating each sentence in chorus as he concludes it. <span class=

<p class="par">A similar ceremony was witnessed in 1897 by Mr. Everard
Fielding and the present writer at the back of the Bungalow at Jugra
(in Selangor). The object of the ceremony was to drive away evil
spirits from the spot where the performance was to take place, and the
performers were a little band of players from Penang who had settled in
the neighbourhood and had planted their holdings with Liberian
coffee.</p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> or magician in this instance
was a Malay named &rsquo;Che Hussein, who acted as clown, and
subsequently wrote out at my request rough transcripts of more than a
dozen of the plays acted by his company.</p>
<p class="par">A big mat or mats having been laid upon the ground in a
spot carefully selected for the purpose, four corner posts were planted
and a big awning or ceiling-cloth (<i lang="ms">langit-langit</i>)
stretched between them. The square space between the posts was then
fenced off by carrying a couple of cords round it horizontally from
post to post, one at the height of two, and the other about five feet
above the ground. From these cords were suspended various ornamental
objects made of plaited strips of cocoa-nut leaf, fashioned into rough
resemblances of animals, birds, fruit and flowers, a few bananas being
added at intervals, these latter serving as light refreshments for the
players whenever they felt so minded. Stems of banana trees with their
leaves fastened at each post made the structure complete, and the
general effect, enhanced by the bright <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb511" href="#pb511" name="pb511">511</a>]</span>costumes of the
performers, was extremely picturesque, and, as it was intended to be,
extremely rural.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26917src" href=
"#xd21e26917" name="xd21e26917src">190</a></p>
<p class="par">A tray with the usual brazier of incense and small bowls
of rice variously prepared was then brought in, and all the
instruments, though not necessarily the players, being in their places,
the ceremony commenced as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">First came the <i lang="ms">Lagu P&#277;manggil</i>, or
Invocation, a peculiar air performed on the instruments and accompanied
by the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i>. The latter heaped incense on a brazier
in front of him, and &ldquo;waved&rdquo; in the incense first the
fiddle (<i lang="ms">r&#277;bab</i>) and then the masks, wooden
daggers, and other &ldquo;properties&rdquo; of the company, until they
were well fumigated. He next lighted three tapers, which he charmed and
took between the closed palms of his hands (held in front of him), with
the fingers straight and the thumbs crossed. He then proceeded to
&ldquo;wave&rdquo; these tapers, pointing them first to the right, then
in front of him, and finally to the left, and then distributed the
tapers, putting the first on the <i lang="ms">r&#277;bab</i>, and the
second on the big gong, and the third on the edge of a brazen ring in
front of the place where he is sitting. He now reached for the
betel-leaf box (which should be close by), and dipping the tip of his
finger into the moist lime which it contained, smeared the metal all
round with it, and <i>made the sign of the cross inside the ring</i>.
Next he shrouded his head with a black cloth, and taking a handful of
rice in his closed fist held it in the incense, sprinkled some of it
over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb512" href="#pb512" name=
"pb512">512</a>]</span>brazier and &ldquo;charmed&rdquo; it, holding it
close to his mouth. Then he suddenly scattered it first to the right,
then in front, and lastly to the left, the scattering being in each
case accompanied by a single boom of the big gong.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The distribution of the rice being completed, he took
four &ldquo;chews&rdquo; of betel and handed one to each of the two
drummers (<i lang="ms">juru-g&#277;ndang</i>); the third he threw on to
the top of the ceiling-cloth (or roof in the case of a shed, <i lang=
"ms">bumbong bangsal</i>), and the fourth he buried underneath the
bottom mat.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26967src" href="#xd21e26967"
name="xd21e26967src">191</a> With his head still shrouded he now placed
the tip of his right thumb within the metal ring, in the very centre of
the cross, called the Heart of the Earth (<i lang="ms">pusat bumi</i>
or <i lang="ms">hati tanah</i>), and pressing downwards with it, worked
it round to the left and back again repeatedly whilst he recited the
necessary charm. After this he leaned in turn on the upper end of each
of the drums, which he inclined over the brazier and
&ldquo;charmed,&rdquo; concluding in each case with three loud taps on
the drum which he was &ldquo;charming,&rdquo; each tap being
accompanied by similar taps on the other two drums. Finally, the
<i lang="ms">Pawang</i> put the flageolet (<i lang=
"ms">s&#277;runei</i>) to his lips, and the other instruments
accompanied him in the performance of the tune called <i lang=
"ms">taboh</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e26992src" href="#xd21e26992"
name="xd21e26992src">192</a></p>
<p class="par">As has already been observed, the performances at these
theatrical exhibitions are of several distinct <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb513" href="#pb513" name=
"pb513">513</a>]</span>kinds, and vary considerably in different
places. The <i lang="ms">Joget</i>, a kind of dramatic and symbolical
dance, has been described under the head of Dances. The <i lang=
"ms">Ma&rsquo;yong</i> is a theatrical performance which includes both
dancing (or posturing as Europeans would be tempted to call it) and
singing. It is generally performed by travelling companies of
professional actors and actresses, who go on tour and perform either at
the houses of Rajas or other persons of some social standing, or before
the general public in some public place.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e27010src" href="#xd21e27010" name="xd21e27010src">193</a> Just as
the dances of the <i lang="ms">Joget</i> are supposed to be symbolical
of different actions and ideas, and are accompanied by appropriate
music, so in the <i lang="ms">Ma&rsquo;yong</i> there is quite a long
list of tunes, each of which is considered to be appropriate to a
particular action, or to some one or more of the <i lang="la">dramatis
person&aelig;</i>. In fact, one may almost say that we have here, in
principle, the rude germ of the Wagnerian <i lang="de">Leitmotif</i>.
Thus when one of the performers is supposed to be sent to sleep, the
<i lang="ms">Lagu L&#277;gor Radin</i> is the one used; in the
representation of a death, the <i lang="ms">Lagu M&#277;rayu</i>; when
a character is supposed to be entering the jungle, the <i lang=
"ms">Lagu Samsam</i>; when any one sits down, the <i lang="ms">Lagu
Patani Tuah</i>. Similarly the <i lang="ms">Lagu Puyuh</i>, the
<i lang="ms">Lagu Dang Dondang Lanjut K&#277;dah</i>, and the <i lang=
"ms">Lagu Sendayong Dualapis P&#365;tri</i> are appropriated to the
Princess (<i lang="ms">P&#365;tri</i>), one of the stock characters of
this species of play, while other tunes can be used only by the
Princess and the Raja or principal male character (<i lang=
"ms">Pa&rsquo;yong</i>); and others, again, are employed indifferently
to accompany any of the parts, whether prince, princess, clown
(<i lang="ms">P&rsquo;ran</i>), or maid (<i lang="ms">Inang</i>).</p>

theatrical exhibitions in general.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The show is called <i lang="ms">Wayang Kulit</i>,

flooring raised about three feet from the ground; the building is
usually twenty feet square and enclosed on three sides, the front alone
being open; across this opening a white sheet is stretched on which the
shadows of the puppets are thrown and seen through by the audience; the

<p class="par">&ldquo;The show seems to be of Hindu origin, if we may
judge from the strong resemblance the figures bear to the
representations of gods and goddesses worshipped by the Hindus of
India; it is probably obtained from Java.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The figures are made of buffalo hide, and the
arms alone are movable; they are moved by slips of wood attached to
them, which are very clumsily contrived, and as their shadows are seen
with the puppets the effect is very much destroyed. Various scenes of a
domestic nature are exhibited, and they take the shape of a play, but
with no definite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb515" href="#pb515"
name="pb515">515</a>]</span>plot running through or connecting the
different scenes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The following is a specimen:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An old man appears weeping for a long-lost son,
and moves to and fro for some time bewailing his loss; the showman
speaks each figure&rsquo;s part, and alters the tone of his voice to
suit the age of the speaker; a second figure comes on, representing a
young man armed with a <i lang="ms">kris</i>, who endeavours to pick a
quarrel with the first comer, and the conversation is witty and
characteristic, eliciting roars of laughter from the lookers-on; a
fight ensues, and the old man is wounded; he falls and cries out that
were he a young man, or if his lost son were present, his adversary
should not thus triumph over him. In his conversation he happens to
mention his son&rsquo;s name; the young man intimates that his name is
the same, an explanation ensues, and it ends by the old man discovering
in his late adversary his long-lost son. The old fellow weeps and
laughs alternately, caresses his son frequently, and declares they
shall never part again; the scene ends by the youth shedding tears over
his late inhuman conduct, and he finally walks off with the old
gentleman on his back.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The conversation is carried on solely in the
Malayan dialect. Warlike scenes please most: a warrior comes on the
stage and challenges his invisible enemy to mortal combat; suddenly
another figure comes on at the opposite side and a desperate fight
ensues, which lasts for a very long time, and ends in one of the
combatants being killed. Occasionally a battle in which ten or twelve
figures join takes place, and for hours will the Malays look on at such
scenes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The show concludes with an exhibition of various

<p class="par first">Such charms as might be used in time of war, or in
case of danger from wild beasts or other enemies, are partly what may
be called &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; and partly &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; in
character.</p>
<p class="par">The Malays who use them pray, on the one hand, for a
supernatural appearance wherewith to scare their enemies and protect
themselves, and on the other for supernatural powers to assist in the
destruction of their foes.</p>
<p class="par">Thus, one of their charms runs:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Let me face the Seven Suns,</p>
<p class="line">But let not my enemies face me.</p>
<p class="line">Ha! I am a Tiger and thou art a Dog.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e27602src" href="#xd21e27602" name=
"xd21e27602src">195</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The use of such charms is supplemented in various
ways: thus a champion (<i lang="ms">p&#277;nglima</i>) will sometimes
draw a line in front of him, which he believes his enemy will be unable
to pass;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27614src" href="#xd21e27614" name=
"xd21e27614src">196</a> this is done by simply scraping the ground with
the right foot and threatening the foe with a dire curse if he attempts
to cross it.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Push and you die, step across and your leg shall
break.</p>
<p class="line">I apply the charm of the Line called the Swollen
Corpse.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">According to another method of gaining martial
vigour and immunity in fighting, you take a wick as long as the short
span between your thumb and first finger (<i lang="ms">sa-j&#277;ngkal
t&#277;lunjok</i>), and after passing it over your body upwards
(<i lang="ms">di-naikkan</i>) thrice, take it between your two hands
and try and turn it round while you repeat the charm. The ceremony must
take place at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb523" href="#pb523" name=
"pb523">523</a>]</span>the time of full moon, and if you do not succeed
in turning it the first time, you can try again at the next full moon,
and so on up to three full moons. At night, if you succeed you will
(according to the Malay account) see the vision of a man, a sign, it is
to be supposed, that the charm has been effectual, and that the prayer
has been heard.</p>
<p class="par">The charm begins as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In the name of God, the merciful, the
compassionate!</p>
<p class="line">May this nerve of stone pierce stone,</p>
<p class="line">Pierce stone and split stone,</p>
<p class="line">Pierce planks and go right through them,</p>
<p class="line">Pierce water and dry it up,</p>
<p class="line">Pierce the earth and make a hole in it,</p>
<p class="line">Pierce the grass and wither it,</p>
<p class="line">Pierce mountains and cause them to fall,</p>
<p class="line">Pierce the heavens that they may fall,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The charm concludes with the following magnificent
boast:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Of Iron am I, and of Copper is my frame,</p>
<p class="line">And my name is &lsquo;Tiger of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">In a somewhat similar charm, a warrior prays that
he may be</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Fenced with Hell-fire up to the eyes;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">and another expresses the wish that his enemies
may be</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ground to powder like tin-ore after
washing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">In actual warfare a number of rules are laid down,
the observance of which is supposed to be necessary in order to achieve
success. As in several other pursuits,<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">When a man is out in the wars his pillows and
sleeping-mat at home have to be kept rolled up. If any one else were to
use them the absent warrior&rsquo;s courage would fail, and disaster
would befall him (<i lang="ms">t&#277;r-tentu-lah kachau hati tuan-nya

must not have their hair cut (<i lang="ms">ta&rsquo; buleh potong
rambut atau b&#277;randam</i>) during his absence, nor may he himself.
Strict chastity must be observed in a stockade, or the bullets of the
garrison will lose their power (<i lang="ms">p&#277;luru jinak di

or even at their weapons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27753src" href=

<p class="par">Bullets are frequently, if not always,
&ldquo;charmed&rdquo; before being used, and their efficacy is supposed
to be increased thereby. The Orang Kaya Pahlawan, a chief of some local
notoriety in recent times, claimed to be invulnerable (<i lang=
"ms">k&#277;bal</i>) to the extent that nothing but a <i>silver</i>
bullet would hurt him.</p>
<p class="par">The following legendary tale illustrates a somewhat
similar idea:&mdash;The assailant, one Magat Terawis, an unknown
warrior who had joined the Sultan&rsquo;s investing army, had four
bullets, on each of which were inscribed the words: &ldquo;This is the
son of the concubine of the Raja of Pagar-ruyong; his name is Magat
Terawis; wherever his bullet falls he will become a Chief.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb525" href="#pb525" name=
"pb525">525</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Magat Terawis levelled his matchlock and fired,
and his bullet struck Tan Saban&rsquo;s leg. The skin was hardly
broken, and the bullet fell to the ground at the chief&rsquo;s feet;
but, on taking it up and reading the inscription, he knew that he had
received his death-wound. He retired to his house, and, after ordering
his flag to be hauled down, despatched a messenger to the opposite camp
to call the warrior whose name he had read on the bullet. Inquiries for
Magat Terawis were fruitless at first, for no one knew the name. At
length he declared himself, and went across the river with Tan
Saban&rsquo;s messenger, who brought him into the presence of the dying
man. The latter said to him, &lsquo;Magat Terawis, thou art my son in
this world and the next, and my property is thine. I likewise give thee
my daughter in marriage, and do thou serve the Raja faithfully in my
place, and not be rebellious as I have been.&rsquo; Tan Saban then sued
for the Sultan&rsquo;s pardon, which was granted to him, and the
marriage of his daughter with Magat Terawis was permitted to take
place. Then Tan Saban died, and was buried with all the honours due to
a Malay chief.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27778src" href=

href="#xd21e27789" name="xd21e27789src">200</a> a short dagger usually
with an undulating or wavy blade set in a handle of peculiarly carved
pattern, as to the probable origin of which some allusion has already
been made,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e27798src" href="#xd21e27798"

chased, hammered, and set with gems in the most elaborate and lavish
style. The blade is quite different in appearance from the steel or
iron blades to which we are accustomed, being prepared in a peculiar
way by a process of &ldquo;damasking&rdquo; which produces a variety of
designs on the roughened surface. To the shape of these designs much
importance is attached, as will appear from the following passage
extracted from Newbold&rsquo;s <i>British Settlements in the Straits of
Malacca:</i>&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Translation of Malayan MS. on Krises and
Process of Damasking</i></p>

<p class="par">&ldquo;If the damasking of a <i lang="ms">kris</i> only
reach within a finger&rsquo;s breadth of the point, and if it reach the
edge, it is inauspicious for combat. Should the damask not be even with
the point, a stab made with such a <i lang="ms">kris</i> would err; but
if even, then the <i lang="ms">kris</i> will never deviate, although
its possessor lose strength to thrust; still, by the grace of God, it
will hit the mark should he cast it at his adversary. If it be damasked
on both sides, it is good; but not so should the damask be separated at
intervals.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If the damask on the point be that of <i lang=
"ms">Alif besar</i> (a damask running in the shape of the Arabian
letter <i lang="ms">Alif</i>), the <i lang="ms">kris</i> is good for
combat; but it is not lucky to wear such a weapon while trading, nor
one in which the damask runs from the <i lang="ms">pangkal</i> (the
stem which runs into the handle), to the <i lang="ms">tali</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If it possess the <i lang="ms">Alif</i> damask

irresistible in fight, nor can any person thwart his wishes.</p>

blade a mixture of boiled rice, sulphur, and salt beat together, first
taking the precaution to cover the edges of the weapon with a thin coat
of virgin wax. After this has remained on seven days, the damask will
have risen to the surface; take the composition off, and immerse the
blade in the water of a young cocoa-nut, or the juice of a pineapple,
for seven days longer, and wash it well with the juice of a sour lemon.
After the rust has been cleared away, rub it with <i lang=

spring water; dry, and anoint it with cocoa-nut oil.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Fasl IV.&mdash;Measurement of
Krises</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Measure the <i lang="ms">kris</i> with a string
below its <i lang="ms">aring</i> (a jutting out of the blade near its
bottom) to its point; cut the string and fold it trebly; cut off one of
the trebles, and with the remaining two measure up the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb529" href="#pb529" name=

mark how far the string reaches. Measure the blade across at this mark,
and find how many times its breadth is contained in two-thirds of its
length; cut the string into as many pieces. These form the <i lang=
"ms">sloca</i>, or measure, of which the <i lang="ms">kris</i>
consists. If none of the string remain over, the blade is perfect, if a
minute portion remain, it is less perfect, but if half the breadth
remain, or more, it is <i lang="ms">chelaka</i>, unlucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Newbold adds:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The <i lang="ms">krises</i> most preferred are
those of the kinds termed Simpana, Cherita, and Sapokal. The <i lang=
"ms">kris panjang</i> is worn generally by the Malayan aristocracy and
bridegrooms. I have seen some beautiful specimens of this weapon in
Rumbowe, worn by the chiefs of that state. The blades resembled that of
a long, keen poniard of Damascus steel; the handles of ebony, covered
with flowered gold, and sheaths richly ornamented with the same metal;
they are used in the execution of criminals. Malays do not prize their
<i lang="ms">krises</i> entirely by the quantity of gold with which
they may be inlaid, but more for their accurate proportions agreeably
to the measurement which is laid down in their treatises on this
subject; the damask on the blade; the antiquity and a certain lucky
quality that they may possess either from accurate proportions, the
damask, the having shed human blood, or from supernatural endowment,
like the famous sword &ldquo;Excalibur.&rdquo; This property is termed
<i lang="ms">betuah</i>, which signifies literally exempt from
accident, invulnerable. The reverse is termed <i lang="ms">chelaka</i>,
ill-omened. They believe the <i lang="ms">betuah</i> in some cases
imparts invulnerability to the possessor of such a <i lang=
"ms">kris</i>, which is handed down as an heirloom from father to son,
and honoured as something divine. The <i lang="ms">kris</i> is, as with
the Javanese, an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb530" href="#pb530"
name="pb530">530</a>]</span>indispensable article in dress on
particular occasions, and there are numerous regulations regarding the
wearing of it. The Undang Undang Malacca<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e28026src" href="#xd21e28026" name="xd21e28026src">205</a>
contains strict injunctions, which are observed to this day, against a
person of inferior birth wearing a <i>kris</i> ornamented with
gold.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28058src" href="#xd21e28058"
name="xd21e28058src">206</a></p>
<p class="par">Besides the mode above described, several other methods
of measuring the <i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i> are also in vogue. They
differ in various matters of detail, and will be found in the
Appendix.</p>
<p class="par">The measurement of one-edged weapons is effected as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Measure the length of the weapon from hilt to point, and
fold the string so measured in two. Measure off this half-length from
the hilt and see how often the breadth of the blade is contained in the
whole length of the string. Each time, however, that the edge is
reached, the string must be marked or dented, and the long end wrapped
round and round the blade, so that the measurement of each breadth is
consecutive to the preceding breadth, the portion of the string which
is stretched across the back of the blade not being counted.</p>
<p class="par">This method is called <i lang="ms">ukor mata
sa-b&rsquo;lah</i>, and is used by Sumatran Malays, especially in
Menangkabau.</p>
<p class="par">Spearheads can also be measured:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb531" href="#pb531" name="pb531">531</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Measure off the length of the spearhead and fold the
string in two; see how often the breadth is contained in the half of
the string; if the blade is a good one, it must be five and a half
times (<i lang="ms">t&#277;ngah anam</i>). This is called <i lang=
"ms">ukor orang Perak</i> or <i lang="ms">ukor t&#277;ngah
anam</i>.</p>
<p class="par">Another superstition connected with weapons is described
as follows by Sir Frank Swettenham. It illustrates the magic powers
attributed to the <i lang="ms">Pawang</i> in so many departments of
nature and life, but does not seem to have any special object or
meaning.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A great many Malays and one or two Europeans may
be found who profess to have seen water drawn from a <i lang=
"ms">kris</i>. The <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> is simple. The
<i lang="ms">p&acirc;wang</i> (I dare not call him conjurer) works with
bare arms to show there is no deception. He takes the <i lang=
"ms">kris</i> (yours, if you prefer it) from its wooden handle, and,
holding the steel point downwards in his left hand, he recites a short
incantation to the effect that he knows all about iron, and where it
comes from, and that it must obey his orders. He then with the thumb
and first two fingers of his right hand proceeds to gently squeeze the
steel, moving his fingers up and down the blade. After a little while a
few drops of water fall from the point of the <i lang="ms">kris</i>,
and these drops quickly develop into a stream that will fill a cup. The
<i lang="ms">p&acirc;wang</i> will then hand round the blade and tell
you to bend it; this you will find no difficulty in doing, but by
making two or three passes over the <i lang="ms">kris</i> the <i lang=
"ms">p&acirc;wang</i> can render it again so hard that it cannot be
bent.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The only drawback to this trick or miracle is
that the process ruins the temper of the steel, and a <i lang=
"ms">kris</i> that has been thus treated is useless.&rdquo;<a class=

<p class="par">The subject of this section, more perhaps than any
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb532" href="#pb532" name=
"pb532">532</a>]</span>of the others, has lost its former importance,
and become almost a matter of merely historical interest. In the Malay
Peninsula, at least in the States which are under British protection,
offensive weapons are seldom worn now-a-days except on State occasions
and for purely ceremonial purposes; and warfare, it may be hoped, is
now a thing of the past. In spite of the halo of romance thrown round
it in native writings, Malay warfare (in modern times, at least) has
never been anything but the barest and most bloodthirsty piracy by sea,
and the merest &ldquo;bushwhacking&rdquo; and stockade-fighting on
land; its final suppression, even if in some degree it should involve a
slackening of fibre in the Malay character, is not a matter for regret.
With it will disappear much of the curious lore that surrounded it, and
indeed a good deal of it must have been lost already. Little has been
said here of the methods of divination used in warfare which take up so
much space in Malay treatises on the subject; success in war is held to
depend on a great number of minute observances, and to be capable of
being foretold by careful attention to omens and signs. But the
divination applied in warfare does not seem to differ in principle from
that which is used in all the other avocations of life, and a
sufficient idea of its nature will be gathered from the account given
in the next section.</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Omens and Dreams</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The significance of ominous signs and dreams is a
subject which possesses vast ramifications, extending so deeply into
every department of the Malay national life, that it will be impossible
to do it anything like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb533" href=
"#pb533" name="pb533">533</a>]</span>full justice within the narrow
limits of this book. My object will be merely to indicate the main
lines on which these two important doctrines of the Malay natural
religion appear to have been developed.</p>
<p class="par">Briefly, then, omens may be drawn either from the acts
of men or the events of nature. Examples of the ominous import
attributed to the acts of man will at once suggest themselves. Thus
sneezing is said to be fortunate as tending to drive away the demons of
disease;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28163src" href="#xd21e28163" name=
"xd21e28163src">208</a> yawning is a bad sign, for obvious reasons, if
the breath is loudly emitted, but if a quiet yawn occurs when the
stomach is craving for food, it imports that it will soon be filled. So
too stumbling is a bad omen, especially if the person who stumbles is
about to set out on a journey.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28172src"
href="#xd21e28172" name="xd21e28172src">209</a> Then, again, &ldquo;to
be long in getting up after a meal is said to be a bad omen. It means
that the person, if unmarried, will meet with a bad reception from his
or her parents-in-law hereafter. The Malay saying in the vernacular is
&lsquo;<i lang="ms">Lambat bangket deri tampat makan, lambat di-tegur
mentuwak</i>.&rsquo; Clothes which have been nibbled by rats or mice
must not be worn again. They are sure to bring misfortune, and are
generally given away in charity. ... When a Malay dinner is served, the
younger members of the family sometimes amuse themselves by throwing
rice into the pan from which the curry has just been taken, stirring it
round in the gravy that remains and then eating it. This is not
permitted when one of them is to be married on the following
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb534" href="#pb534" name=
"pb534">534</a>]</span>day, as it would be sure to bring rainy weather.
It is unlucky for a child to lie on his face (<i lang=
"ms">menyehrap</i>), and kick his feet together in the air (<i lang=
"ms">menyabong kaki</i>). It betokens that either his father or mother
will die. A child seen doing this is instantly rebuked and
stopped....</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The evil eye is dreaded by Malays. Not only are
particular people supposed to be possessed of a quality which causes
ill-luck to accompany their glance (the <i lang=
"it">mal&rsquo;occhio</i> of the Italians), but the influence of the
evil eye is often supposed to affect children, who are taken notice of
by people kindly disposed towards them. For instance, it is unlucky to
remark on the fatness and healthiness of a baby, and a Malay will
employ some purely nonsensical word, or convey his meaning in a
roundabout form, rather than incur possible misfortune by using the
actual word &lsquo;fat.&rsquo; &lsquo;<i lang="ms">Ai bukan-nia poh-poh
gental budak ini?</i>&rsquo; (&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t this child nice and
round?&rsquo;) is the sort of phrase which is
permissible.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28198src" href=
"#xd21e28198" name="xd21e28198src">210</a></p>
<p class="par">Among omens drawn from natural events are the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When a star is seen in apparent proximity to the
moon, old people say there will be a wedding shortly....</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The entrance into a house of an animal which does
not generally seek to share the abode of man is regarded by the Malays
as ominous of misfortune. If a wild bird flies into a house it must be
carefully caught and smeared with oil, and must then be released in the
open air, a formula being recited in which it is bidden to fly away
with all the ill-luck and misfortunes <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb535" href="#pb535" name="pb535">535</a>]</span>(<i lang="ms">sial
jambalang</i>) of the occupier. An iguana, a tortoise, and a snake, are
perhaps the most dreaded of these unnatural visitors. They are
sprinkled with ashes, if possible, to counteract their evil
influence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A swarm of bees settling near a house is an
unlucky omen, and prognosticates misfortune.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e28219src" href="#xd21e28219" name="xd21e28219src">211</a></p>
<p class="par">So, too, omens are taken either from the flight or cries
of certain birds, such as the night-owl, the crow, some kinds of wild
doves, and the bird called the &ldquo;Rice&rsquo;s Husband&rdquo;
(<i lang="ms">laki padi</i>).</p>
<p class="par">Passing from the idea of mere omens drawn from
fortuitous events we easily arrive at the idea of a conscious attempt
on the part of the worshipper to ascertain the divine pleasure with
respect to a sacrifice newly offered. This effort of the worshippers
becomes crystallised in time into a sub-rite, which yet forms an
integral portion of most, if not all, of the more important
ceremonies,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28231src" href="#xd21e28231"
name="xd21e28231src">212</a> and eventually develops into a special and
separate rite called <i lang="ms">Tilek</i> (divination), of which
examples will now be given.</p>
<p class="par">One form of this rite was taught by a Malay of Penang
extraction, whose instructions, taken down by me at the time, ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Take a lemon (<i lang="ms">limau purut</i>), a
hen&rsquo;s egg, a taper made of bees&rsquo;-wax (<i lang="ms">lilin
l&#277;bah</i>), four bananas, four Malay (palm-leaf covered)
cigarettes, four &ldquo;chews&rdquo; of betel-leaf, a handful of
parched rice, washed rice, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb536" href=
"#pb536" name="pb536">536</a>]</span>and rice stained with turmeric
(saffron), one of the prickles or &ldquo;thorns&rdquo; (<i lang=
"ms">duri</i>) of a thorn-backed mudfish, a needle with a torn eye
(taken out of one of the sets of a &ldquo;score&rdquo; in which they
are sold&mdash;<i lang="ms">jarum rabit dalam s&#277;kudi</i>), and a
couple of small whips, or rather birches, one of which must be composed
of seven, and the other of twelve, leaf-ribs of the &ldquo;green&rdquo;
cocoa-nut palm (<i lang="ms">niyor hijau</i>).</p>
<p class="par">Two of the bananas, two cigarettes, two chews of
&ldquo;betel,&rdquo; half of each of the three kinds of rice, the egg,
and the birch of seven twigs, must now be taken outside the house and
set down under a tree selected for the purpose. When setting it down
the egg must be cracked, the cigarettes lighted, and finally the taper
also. On one occasion when I witnessed the performance, the taper,
after being taken up between the outstretched fingers of my
friend&rsquo;s two hands, was waved slowly to and fro&mdash;first to
the right and then to the left; finally it was set down on the ground
and began to burn blue, the flame becoming more and more dim until it
almost expired. On seeing this the medicine-man exclaimed, &ldquo;He
has promised&rdquo; (<i lang="ms">dia m&#277;ngaku</i>), and led the
way back to the house, where he proceeded to go through the remainder
of the ceremony.</p>
<p class="par">First, he deposited the brazier with incense upon the
leaf of a banana-tree, then took the prickle of the fish and thrust it
horizontally through the lower end of the lemon, leaving both ends
exposed; then he thrust the needle through in a transverse direction,
so as to form a cross, the ends of the needle being likewise exposed,
and slipped the noosed end of a piece of silken thread of seven
different colours over the points thus exposed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb537" href="#pb537" name="pb537">537</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Next he scattered the rice round the censer and
fumigated the birch and the lemon, recited a charm as he held the
latter in his right hand, recited the charm for the second
time<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28307src" href="#xd21e28307" name=
"xd21e28307src">213</a> as he took the birch in both hands, with the
upper end close to his mouth and the lower (spreading) end over the
brazier, and finally repeated the charm for a third time, suspending,
as he did so, the lemon over the brazier by means of the thread held in
his left hand and holding the birch in the right.</p>
<p class="par">Everything being ready, he now began to put questions to
the lemon into which the spirit was supposed to have entered, rebuking
it and threatening it with the birch whenever it failed to answer
distinctly and to the point. The conversational powers of this spirit
were extremely limited, being confined to two signs signifying
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The affirmative was indicated
by a pendulum-like swaying of the lemon, which rocked to and fro with
more or less vehemence according to the emphasis (as my friend informed
me) with which the reply was to be delivered. Negation, on the other
hand, was indicated by a complete cessation of motion on the part of
the lemon.</p>
<p class="par">When it is required to discover, for instance, the name
of a thief, the names of all those who are at all likely to have
committed the theft are written on scraps of paper and arranged in a
circle round the brazier, when the lemon will at once swing in the
direction of the name of the guilty party. The best night for the
performance of this ceremony is a Tuesday. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb538" href="#pb538" name="pb538">538</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Sir Frank Swettenham&rsquo;s account of a similar
ceremony of which he was an eye-witness will serve as a good
illustration of the methods in use for this purpose:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was my misfortune some years ago to be robbed
of some valuable property, and several Malay friends strongly advised
me to take the advice of an astrologer, or other learned person who (so
they said) would be able to give the name of the thief, and probably
recover most of the stolen things. I fear that I had no great faith in
this method of detection, but I was anxious to see what could be done,
for the East is a curious place, and no one with an inquiring mind can
have lived in it long without seeing phenomena that are not always
explained by modern text-books on Natural Philosophy.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was first introduced to an Arab of very
remarkable appearance. He was about fifty years old, tall, with
pleasant features and extraordinary gray-blue eyes, clear and
far-seeing, a man of striking and impressive personality. I was
travelling when I met him, and tried to persuade him to return with me,
but that he said he could not do, though he promised to follow me by an
early steamer. He said he would be able to tell me all about the
robbery, who committed it, where the stolen property then was, and that
all he would want was an empty house wherein he might fast in solitude
for three days, without which preparation, he said, he would not be
able to see what he sought. He told me that after his vigil, fast, and
prayer, he would lay in his hand a small piece of paper on which there
would be some writing; into this he would pour a little water, and in
that extemporised mirror he would see a vision of the whole
transaction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb539" href="#pb539" name=
"pb539">539</a>]</span>He declared that, after gazing intently into
this divining-glass, the inquirer first recognised the figure of a
little old man. That having duly saluted this <i lang="ms">Jin</i>, it
was necessary to ask him to conjure up the scene of the robbery, when
all the details would be re-enacted in the liquid glass under the eyes
of the gazer, who would there and then describe all that he saw. I had
heard all this before, only it had been stated to me then that the
medium through whose eyes the vision could alone be seen must be a
young child of such tender years that it could have never told a lie!
The Arab, however, professed himself not only able to conjure up the
scene, but to let me see it for myself if I would follow his
directions. Unfortunately, my gray-eyed friend failed to keep his
promise, and I never met him again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A local Chief, however, declared his power to
read the past by this method, if only he could find the truthful child.
In this he appeared to succeed, but when, on the following day, he came
to disclose to me the results of his skill, he said that a difficulty
had arisen, because just when the child (a little boy) was beginning to
relate what he saw he suddenly became unconscious, and it took the
astrologer two hours to restore him to his normal state. All the
mothers of tender-aged and possibly truthful children declined after
this to lend their offspring for the ordeal.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My friend was not, however, at the end of his
resources, and, though only an amateur in divination, he undertook to
try by other methods to find the culprit. For this purpose he asked me
to give him the names of every one in the house at the time the robbery
was committed. I did so, and the next day he gave me one of those names
as that of the thief. I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb540" href=
"#pb540" name="pb540">540</a>]</span>asked how he had arrived at this
knowledge; he described the method, and consented to repeat the
experiment in my presence. That afternoon I went with him to a small
house belonging to his sister. Here I found the Chief, his sister, and
two men whom I did not recognise. We all sat in a very small room, the
Chief in the centre with a copy of the Kor&acirc;n on a reading-stand,
near to him the two men opposite to each other, the sister against one
wall, and I in a corner. A clean, new, unglazed earthenware bowl with a
wide rim was produced. This was filled with water and a piece of fair
white cotton cloth tied over the top, making a surface like that of a
drum.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was asked to write the name of each person
present in the house when the robbery was committed on a small piece of
paper, and to fold each paper up so that all should be alike, and then
to place one of the names on the cover of the vessel. I did so, and the
proceedings began by the two men placing each the middle joint of the
fore-finger of his right hand under the rim of the bowl on opposite
sides, and so supporting it about six inches above the floor. The
vessel being large and full of water was heavy, and the men supported
the strain by resting their right elbows on their knees as they sat
cross-legged on the floor and face to face. It was then that I selected
one of the folded papers, and placed it on the cover of the vessel. The
Chief read a page of the Kor&acirc;n, and as nothing happened he said
that was not the name of the guilty person, and I changed the paper for
another. This occurred four times, but at the fifth the reading had
scarcely commenced when the bowl began to slowly turn round from left
to right, the supporters letting their hands go round with it, until it
twisted itself out of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb541" href=
"#pb541" name="pb541">541</a>]</span>their fingers and fell on the
floor with a considerable bang and a great spluttering of water through
the thin cover. &lsquo;That,&rsquo; said the Chief, &lsquo;is the name
of the thief.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was the name of the person already mentioned
by him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I did not, however, impart that piece of
information to the company, but went on to the end of my papers,
nothing more happening.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I said I should like to try the test again, and
as the Chief at once consented we began afresh, and this time I put the
name of the suspected person on first, and once more the vessel turned
round and twisted itself out of the hands of the holders till it fell
on the floor, and I was surprised it did not break. After trying a few
more I said I was satisfied, and the ordeal of the bowl was over. Then
the Chief asked me whose name had been on the vessel when it moved, and
I told him. It was a curious coincidence certainly. I wrote the names
in English, which no one could read; moreover, I was so placed that no
one could see what I wrote, and they none of them attempted to do so.
Then the papers were folded up so as to be all exactly alike; they were
shuffled together, and I did not know one from the other till I looked
inside myself. Each time I went from my corner and placed a name on the
vessel already held on the fingers of its supporters. No one except I
touched the papers, and no one but the Chief ever spoke till the
<i>s&eacute;ance</i> was over. I asked the men who held the bowl why
they made it turn round at that particular moment, but they declared
they had nothing to do with it, and that the vessel twisted itself off
their fingers against their inclination. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb542" href="#pb542" name="pb542">542</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The name disclosed by this experiment was
certainly that of the person whom there was most reason to suspect, but
beyond that I learnt nothing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Another plan for surprising the secret of the
suspected person is to get into the room where that person is sleeping,
and after making certain passes to question the slumberer, when he may
truthfully answer all the questions put to him. This is a favourite
device of the suspicious husband.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yet another plan is to place in the hand of a
<i lang="ms">p&acirc;wang</i>, magician, or medium, a divining-rod
formed of three lengths of rattan, tied together at one end, and when
he gets close to the person &lsquo;wanted,&rsquo; or to the place where
anything stolen is concealed, the rod vibrates in a remarkable
manner.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e28356src" href="#xd21e28356"
name="xd21e28356src">214</a></p>
<p class="par">A somewhat analogous practice is the ordeal by diving,
described by the late Sir W. E. Maxwell as &ldquo;a method of deciding
a disputed point which was occasionally resorted to in Perak in former
times. I got the following account of the manner of conducting the
ordeal from a Malay chief who saw it carried out once at Tanjong
Sanendang near Pasir Sala, in the reign of Sultan Abdullah Mohamed
Shah, father of the present Raja Muda Yusuf:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The ordeal by diving requires the sanction of the
Sultan himself, and must be conducted in the presence of the Orang
Besar Ampat, or Four Chiefs of the first rank. If two disputants in an
important question agree to settle their difference in this way they
apply to the Raja, who fixes a day (usually three days off) for the
purpose, and orders that a certain sum of money shall abide the event.
This appointment of time and place is the first stage in the
proceedings, and is called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb543" href=
"#pb543" name="pb543">543</a>]</span><i lang="ms">bertepat janji</i>,
and the laying of the bet or deposit of stakes is called <i lang=
"ms">bertiban taroh</i>. On the day appointed the parties attend with
their friends at the Raja&rsquo;s <i lang="ms">balei</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e28376src" href="#xd21e28376" name=
"xd21e28376src">215</a> and there, in the presence of the Court, a
<i lang="ms">krani</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e28382src" href=
"#xd21e28382" name="xd21e28382src">216</a> writes down a solemn
declaration for each person, each maintaining the truth of his side of
the question. The first, invoking the name of God, the intercession of
the Prophet, and the tombs of the deceased Sultans of the country,
asserts the affirmative proposition, and his adversary with the same
solemnity records his denial. This is called <i lang="ms">bertangkap
mangmang</i> or &lsquo;taking up the challenge.&rsquo; Each paper is
then carefully rolled up by the <i lang="ms">krani</i>, and is placed
by him in a separate bamboo tube; the ends of both are then sealed up.
When thus prepared the bamboo tubes are exactly alike, and no one, not
even the <i lang="ms">krani</i>, can tell which contains the assertion
and which the denial. Two boys are then selected; one of the bamboos is
given to each, and they are led down to the river, where the Raja and
Chiefs take up their station, and the people flock down in crowds. Two
stakes have been driven into the bed of the river in a pool previously
selected, and the boys are placed beside them, up to their necks in
water. A pole is placed horizontally on their heads, and on a given
signal this is pressed downwards, and the boys are made to sink at the
same moment. Each holds on to his post under water and remains below as
long as he can. As soon as one gives in and appears above water his
bamboo tube is snatched from him and hurled far out into the stream.
The victor is led up in triumph to the <i lang="ms">balei</i>, and the
crowd surges up to hear the result. His bamboo is then opened and the
winner declared.</p>

any kind of work, for going on a voyage, sailing, or planting, and very

to God Almighty. Jibra&rsquo;il&rsquo;s time is fairly lucky too, being
good for planting and profitable for trading, and if gold or silver is
lost then, it will be quickly found, but there may be some trouble in
getting it back; a lost buffalo <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb548"

southwards, but will be recovered after some slight trouble; if you go
to war at this time you must wear green, but must not face towards the
south. Ibrahim&rsquo;s time is most unlucky, and going out then is sure
to involve bloodshed or other misfortune; bad news is true, good is
false; things lost then will not be recovered; going to war is ruinous,

it is best to stay at home altogether at this time.</p>

<p class="par">According to one view, which is perhaps the prevalent
one, every man&rsquo;s luck is determined by one or other of the
zodiacal constellations, and in order to find out which one it is, the
following direction is given:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Reckon the numerical equivalent of the
person&rsquo;s name and of the name of his mother by the values of the
letters according to the system of the Abjad; add the two numerical
equivalents together, and divide the total by twelve; if the remainder
is 1, his sign is the Ram, if 2, the Bull, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Each constellation has a series of characteristics which
are supposed to influence the whole life of the person who is subject
to it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e29082src" href="#xd21e29082" name=
"xd21e29082src">234</a></p>
<p class="par">Besides the above, a few of the other constellations are
known to possess Malay names, and wherever this is the case, the name
given appears usually to be quite original, having no connection with
the nomenclature obtaining among nations with which we are more
familiar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e29093src" href="#xd21e29093" name=
"xd21e29093src">235</a></p>
<p class="par">In addition to the above, the Malays possess a curious
system by which the lunar month is divided into a number of parts
called <i lang="ms">R&#277;jang</i>. According to Newbold, &ldquo;the
twenty-eight <i lang="ms">R&#277;jangs</i> resemble the Nacshatras or
lunar mansions of the Hindoos, rather than <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb552" href="#pb552" name="pb552">552</a>]</span>the
Anwa of the Arabs&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e29159src" href=
"#xd21e29159" name="xd21e29159src">236</a> and it is <i>a priori</i>
very probable that they owe their origin to this Hindu system. But by
the Malays their application has been generally misunderstood, and
their number is usually raised to thirty so as to fit the days of the
lunar month. Each of these divisions has its symbol, which is usually
an animal, and the first animal in the list is (in almost all versions)
the horse. A horse&rsquo;s head is also the figure of the first of the
Hindu Nakshatras, but there seems to be little trace of identity in the
remaining figures, which for the sake of comparison are given, side by
side with the Malay symbols, in the Appendix. The Malays have embodied
this system in a series of mnemonic verses (known as <i lang=
"ms">Sha&#703;ir R&#277;jang</i>), of which there are several versions,
<i>e.g.</i> the <i lang="ms">R&#277;jang</i> of &rsquo;Che Busu, the
<i lang="ms">R&#277;jang Sindiran Maiat</i>, and others.<a class=

"xd21e29184src">237</a></p>
<p class="par">The <i lang="ms">R&#277;jangs</i> are also dealt with at
length in prose treatises: one of these, which identifies the <i lang=
"ms">R&#277;jangs</i> with the days of the lunar month, begins
&ldquo;on the first day of the month, whose <i lang=
"ms">r&#277;jang</i> is a horse, God Almighty created the prophet Adam;
this day is good for planting, travelling, and sailing, and trading on
this day will be profitable; it is also a good day for a wedding, and
on this day it is lucky to be attacked (<i>i.e.</i> in war), but rather
unlucky to take the offensive; ... good news received (at this time) is
true, bad news is false; property lost (on this day) will soon be
recovered; the man who stole it is short of stature, with scanty hair,
a round face, a slender figure and a yellow complexion; the property
has been placed in a house, ... under the care of a dark man; ... if a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb553" href="#pb553" name=

fortunate; if one is ill on this day, one will quickly recover; the
proper remedy for driving away the evil (<i lang="ms">tolak bala</i>),
is <i>to make a representation of a horse and throw it away towards

system of divination seems to agree in its main features with those
which have already been described.</p>

completeness, to allude briefly to those that remain.</p>

<p class="par">This remark is still true, no doubt, of the up-country
Malays on the West Coast, but in most districts, and to an extent
commensurate with European influence, the solar year is now being
gradually introduced.</p>
<p class="par">The same remark applies to the method of reckoning
months, a dual system being now in vogue in many places where there is
most contact with Europeans. Regarding the native methods the following
quotation is to the point:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are three ways of reckoning the months.
First, the Arabian, computing thirty days to the first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb554" href="#pb554" name=
"pb554">554</a>]</span>month, and twenty-nine to the second month, and
so on alternately to the end of the year.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Second, the Persian mode, viz. thirty days to
each month; and, thirdly, that of Rum, <i>i.e.</i> thirty-one days to
the month. The first is in general use. Some few, with greater
accuracy, calculate their year at 354 days eight hours, intercalating
every three years twenty-four hours, or one day to make up the
deficiency, and thirty-three days for the difference between the solar
and lunar years.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But the majority of the lower classes estimate
their year by the fruit seasons and by their crops of rice only. Many,
however, obstinately adhere to the lunar months, and plant their paddy
at the annual return of the lunar month.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Malay months have been divided into weeks of
seven days, marked by the return of the Mohammedan Sabbath. Natives who
have had intercourse with Europeans divide the day and night into
twenty-four parts, but the majority measure the day by the sun&rsquo;s
apparent progress through the heavens, the crow of the cock, etc. The
religious day commences at sunset, like that of the Arabs and
Hebrews.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are two cycles borrowed from the Arabs, and
known only to a few, viz. one of 120 years, the <i lang=
"ms">dour<a class="noteref" id="xd21e29263src" href="#xd21e29263" name=
"xd21e29263src">240</a> besar</i>, and the other of eight, <i lang=
"ms">dour kechil</i>. The latter is sometimes seen in dates of letters,
and resembles the mode adopted by us of distinguishing by letters the
different days of the week, substituting eight years for the seven
days. The order of the letters is as follows: <i lang=
"ms">Alif-ha-jim-za-dal-ba-wau-dal-Ahajazdabuda</i>. The present year
(1251) is the year <i lang="ms">Toun-za</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In a Malay MS. history of Patani, in my
possession, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb555" href="#pb555" name=

<p class="par">Most if not all these systems of reckoning seem to have
been treated by the Malays from the astrological point of view as
forming a basis for divination, and these crude notions of the lucky or
unlucky nature of certain times and seasons are to some extent
systematised by or in some degree mixed up with the idea of the mystic
influence of numbers and geometrical figures.</p>
<p class="par">Of the mystic figures used in divination, the first in
importance is, no doubt, what has been called the &ldquo;magic
square,&rdquo; a term applied to &ldquo;a set of numbers arranged in a
square in such a manner that the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal
columns shall give the same sums.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par">The ordinary Malay astrologer most likely understands
very little of the peculiar properties of a magic square, and
consequently he not unfrequently makes mistakes in the arrangement of
the figures. I believe, also, that in using the squares for purposes of
divination he now usually begins at one corner and counts straight on,
the beginning place being almost always distinguished by a small
solitary crescent or crescent and star just over the square.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e29916src" href="#xd21e29916" name=
"xd21e29916src">243</a> When coloured squares are introduced, as is the
case with several of the 5-squares, the sum of 25 squares is subdivided
into five sets or groups of five squares each, a different colour being
assigned to each group. These colours would no doubt retain the
comparative values usually assigned <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb557" href="#pb557" name="pb557">557</a>]</span>to them by Malay
astrologers. Thus white would be the best of all; yellow, as the royal
colour, little, if at all inferior to white; brown, blue, or red would
be medium colours; black would be bad, and so on.</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes, again, the names of the five Hindu deities
already mentioned will be found similarly arranged, in which case they
appear to refer to the divisions of the day, described above under the
name of <i lang="ms">Katika Lima</i>. Besides this class of magic
squares, however, there are other kinds which present irregularities,
and are not so easily explainable. Some of these violate the
fundamental rule of the magic square, which insists that each square
shall have an equal number of small squares running each way, and that
this number shall be an odd one.</p>
<p class="par">Others exhibit the right number of small squares (3
&times; 3 or 5 &times; 5 or 7 &times; 7), but instead of a subdivision
into sub-groups, have merely an arrangement of alternative emblems,
such as a bud and a full-blown flower, or the like.</p>
<p class="par">An analysis of the squares whose figures are given in
the illustrations shows that the order of the colours, deities, and
planets is by no means always the same.</p>

<p class="par">The way in which these figures were used for divination
is very clearly shown by Pl. 25, Fig. 1, which is copied from a figure
in one of my (Selangor) charm-books, which had the days of the month,
from the 1st to the 30th, written round it in blue ink. Starting from
the north aspect, you count round to the left until (allowing one day
to each aspect) you arrive at the aspect corresponding to the number of
the day of the month upon which you wish to start your journey. If it
coincides with an aspect assigned to one of the weaker influences, it
will be most imprudent to start on that day. Start on a day assigned to
one of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb560" href="#pb560" name=
"pb560">560</a>]</span>stronger influences, and you will be all right.
If the first aspect-compass which you consult is not accommodating
enough for your requirements, go on consulting others until you find
one which is satisfactory.</p>
<p class="par">Other forms of the compass-figure are used for divining
whether if he starts on a certain day the man will get the better of
his enemy, or meet with a person (<i>e.g.</i> a slave or a thief) who
has run away. In the former case a double circle of human figures is
used, the figures of the inner circle representing the person who seeks
the information, and those of the outer circle his enemy. The counting
is carried out in precisely the same manner as before, and the headless
figure in each case represents the man who will lose. In the case of a
drawn battle neither party, of course, loses his head.</p>
<p class="par">In the case of an absconder, a single circle of figures
is used, the figures pointing towards the centre signifying that the
absconding party will return or be caught, and those pointing away from
the centre signifying the opposite. In one case (Pl. 25, Fig. 2) there
are fourteen human figures arranged in two opposing rows of seven,
every alternate figure being headless. In this case you start the
counting at the right-hand figure of the bottom row, and count towards
the left. Yet another form of divination in which the human figure is
made use of, is shown in Pl. 25, Fig. 1; a number of small red circles
(which should be alternately dark and light) are drawn at the salient
points of the figure, and counted down to the left in order, beginning
at the head. All I have yet been able to discover about the
villainous-looking individual here portrayed is the fact that he is
said to represent one &ldquo;Unggas T&#277;lang,&rdquo; who was
described to me as an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb561" href=

Abu Talib</i> (the body or bier of Our Lord &#703;Ali, the son of Abu

quarters of the heavens, and <i>must not be faced</i>; for if one faces
towards it, one is sure to be defeated in battle or fight.&rdquo; The
aspect to be avoided varies from day to day, turning towards each of
the eight points of the ordinary Malay compass three or four times in
the lunar month.</p>
<p class="par">The subject of omens in general has been shortly dealt
with at the beginning of this section, and also incidentally mentioned
in connection with various departments of nature and human life. It
would hardly be possible to make a complete or systematic list of the
things from which omens are taken. Apart from those depending merely on
Times, Seasons, Numbers, and Aspect, which have been already dealt with
at quite sufficient length, it may be noted that omens are drawn from
earthquakes, thunder, &ldquo;house-lizards, rats, and other four-footed
things,&rdquo; according to the times at which they are observed, from
the colour, smell, and nature of soil (in choosing building-sites),
from birds, and, in fact, from a very large variety of matters which
cannot be classified under any general head. The lines of the hand are,
of course, interpreted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb562" href=
"#pb562" name="pb562">562</a>]</span>among the Malays, as elsewhere, as
signs of good and evil fortune. It has not been possible to collect
much information on the subject of Malay chiromancy, but for the
benefit of European adepts in &ldquo;palmistry&rdquo; (as it seems to
be usually styled nowadays) it may be worth while mentioning that the
Malays attach importance, as an indication of long life (<i lang=
"ms">&#703;alamat panjang &#703;umor</i>),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e30434src" href="#xd21e30434" name="xd21e30434src">248</a> to the
intersection of the line round the base of the thumb<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e30437src" href="#xd21e30437" name="xd21e30437src">249</a> with
the one which runs round the wrist (<i lang="ms">simpeian
&#703;Ali</i>), while a broken line across the palm (<i lang=
"ms">r&#277;tak putus</i>) is believed by them to be a sign of
invulnerability (<i lang="ms">tanda p&#277;ngg&#277;tas</i>, <i lang=
"ms">ta&rsquo; buleh di-tikam</i>). Upright lines running up the lower
joints of the fingers, in the same line as the fingers themselves, are
a sign of prospective wealth (<i lang="ms">&#703;alamat &rsquo;nak
di-panjat d&#277;&rsquo; duit</i>, <i lang="ms">tanda orang kaya</i>),
and a whorl of circular lines on the fingers (<i lang="ms">pusat
b&#277;lanak</i>) is a sign of a craftsman (<i lang="ms">&#703;alamat
orang tukang</i>).</p>
<p class="par">More important, perhaps, are the omens believed to be
derived from dreams, of which there seem to be several different
methods of interpretation. According to one system the initial letter
of the thing dreamt of determines the luck: thus to dream of a thing
beginning with T is very lucky indeed, to dream of a thing beginning
with H means that a visitor from a distance is to be expected; N
indicates sorrow, L is a hint to give alms to the poor and needy, and
so forth. According to another system, a purely arbitrary meaning is
put upon the subject-matter of the dream, or, at most, some slight
analogy is the basis of the interpretation. Thus to dream of a gale of
wind in the early morning is an omen of sorrow, to dream of hail
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb563" href="#pb563" name=
"pb563">563</a>]</span>means acquisition of property, to dream of
bathing in a heavy shower of rain indicates escape from a very great
danger, a dream about mosquitoes, flies, and the like, means that an
enemy is coming to the village, to dream about eating jack-fruit
(<i lang="ms">nangka</i>) or plantain (<i lang="ms">pisang</i>) is an
indication of great trouble impending, and so on; an extract from a
treatise on this subject is given in the Appendix, and it is impossible
to dwell at greater length upon it here. Among Malay gamblers special
importance is attached to dreams as an indication of luck in gambling
(<i lang="ms">mimpi paksa</i> or <i lang="ms">dapat paksa</i>). If the
gambler dreams of &ldquo;sweeping out the gambling farm&rdquo;
(<i lang="ms">m&#277;nyapu pajak</i>), <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;breaking the
bank,&rdquo; or of running <i lang="ms">amok</i> in it (<i lang=
"ms">m&#277;ngamok pajak</i>), or of bailing out the ocean (<i lang=
"ms">m&#277;nimba lautan</i>), or of the ocean running dry (<i lang=
"ms">lautan k&rsquo;ring</i>), or even of his breeding maggots on his
person (<i lang="ms">badan b&#277;rulat</i>), he is confident of great
good fortune in the near future.</p>
<p class="par">As a specimen of the importance traditionally ascribed
to dreams, it seems worth while to give the following popular legend,
which also illustrates the type of folk-tales in which hidden treasure
plays a great part:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Che Puteh Jambai and his wife were very poor
people, who lived many generations ago at Pulo Kambiri on the Perak
river. They had so few clothes between them that when one went out the
other had to stay at home. Nothing seemed to prosper with them, so
leaving Pulo Kambiri, where their poverty made them ashamed to meet
their neighbours, they moved up the river to the spot since called
Jambai. Shortly after they had settled here Che Puteh was troubled by a
portent which has disturbed the slumbers of many great men from the
time of Pharaoh downwards. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb564" href=
"#pb564" name="pb564">564</a>]</span>He dreamed a dream. And in his
dream he was warned by a supernatural visitant to slay his wife, this
being, he was assured, the only means by which he could hope to better
his miserable condition.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sorely disturbed in mind, but never doubting that
the proper course was to obey, Che Puteh confided to his wife the
commands which he had received, and desired her to prepare for death.
The unhappy lady acquiesced with that conjugal submissiveness which in
Malay legends, as in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, is so characteristic of
the Oriental female when landed in some terrible predicament. But she
craved and obtained permission to first go down to the river and wash
herself with lime juice. So taking a handful of limes she went forth,
and, standing on the rock called Batu Pembunoh, she proceeded to
perform her ablutions after the Malay fashion. The prospect of
approaching death, we may presume, unnerved her, for in dividing the
limes with a knife she managed to cut her own hand and the blood
dripped down on the rocks and into the river; as each drop was borne
away by the current, a large jar immediately rose to the surface and
floated, in defiance of all natural laws, <i>up-stream</i> to the spot
whence the blood came. As each jar floated up Che Puteh&rsquo;s wife
tapped it with her knife and pulled it in to the edge of the rocks. On
opening them she found them all full of gold. She then went in search
of her husband and told him of the treasure of which she had suddenly
become possessed. He spared her life, and they lived together in the
enjoyment of great wealth and prosperity for many years. Their old age
was clouded, it is believed, by the anxiety attending the possession of
a beautiful daughter, who was born to them after they became rich. She
grew up to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb565" href="#pb565" name=
"pb565">565</a>]</span>perfection of loveliness, and all the Rajas and
Chiefs of the neighbouring countries were her suitors. The multitude of
rival claims so bewildered the unhappy parents that, after concealing a
great part of their riches in various places, they disappeared and have
never since been seen. Their property was never found by their
children, though, in obedience to instructions received in dreams, they
braved sea-voyages and went to seek for it in the distant lands of
Kachapuri and Jamulepor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Several places near Jambai connected with the
legend of Che Puteh are still pointed out; at Bukit Bunyian the
treasure was buried and still lies concealed. A deep gorge leading down
to the river is the ghaut down which Che Puteh&rsquo;s vast flocks of
buffaloes used to go to the river. Its size is evidence of the great
number of the animals, and therefore of the wealth of their owner. Two
deep pools, called respectively Lubuk Gong and Lubuk Sarunai, contain a
golden gong and a golden flute which were sunk here by Che Puteh
Jambai. The flute may sometimes be seen lying on one of the surrounding
rocks, but always disappears into the depths of the pool before any
mortal can approach it. The treasures of Lubuk Gong might before now
have passed into human possession, had it not been for the covetousness
of the individual selected as their recipient. A Malay of Ulu Perak was
told in a dream to go and fish in the pool of the gong and to take a
pair of betel-nut scissors (<i lang="ms">kachip</i>) with him. He was
to use the <i lang="ms">kachip</i> immediately on being told to do so.
Next morning he was at the pool early, and at his first cast hooked
something heavy and commenced to draw it up. When the hook appeared
above water there was a gold chain attached <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb566" href="#pb566" name="pb566">566</a>]</span>to
it. The lucky fisherman then commenced to pull up the chain into his
canoe, and hauled up fathoms of it, hand over hand, until the boat
could hardly hold any more. Just then a little bird alighted on a
branch close by and piped out a couple of notes, which sounded for all
the world like <i lang="ms">kachip</i>. The man heard, but he wanted a
little more, and he went on hauling. &lsquo;<i lang=
"ms">Kachip</i>,&rsquo; said the bird again. &lsquo;Just a very little
more,&rsquo; thought the fisherman, and he still continued dragging up
the chain. Again and again the warning note sounded, but in vain, and
suddenly a strong pull from the bottom of the pool dragged back the
chain, and before the Malay had time to divide it with his tweezers,
the last link of it had disappeared beneath the water.&rdquo;<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">While by divination and by inferences from omens
and dreams, Malays attempt to ascertain the course of fate, so by
charms of the nature of amulets and talismans they sometimes endeavour
to influence its direction or modify its force. Charms of the nature of
invocations have been dealt with already under different headings in
connection with a variety of matters, and it will only be necessary to
refer here to a few miscellaneous ones of a less elaborate character.
It should be observed that some charms are directly effective or
protective, like amulets or talismans, while others are supposed to
work only by influencing the volition of another mind. Under the latter
head come the great mass of love-charms, charms for securing conjugal
fidelity, or for compelling the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb567"
href="#pb567" name="pb567">567</a>]</span>revelation by another person
of his or her secret thoughts, and the like, of which Malay books of
magic are full; while under the former come sundry recipes of a more or
less medicinal nature for the purpose of curing various diseases, of
increasing physical power or virility, or of protecting the person
against evil influences, natural or supernatural. In most of these
cases the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> is of the simplest character;
the charm consists usually of a short Arabic prayer or a few letters
and figures, sometimes quite meaningless and conventional, sometimes
making up one or more of the sacred names (Allah, Muhammad, &#703;Ali,
etc.). These charms are written on paper or cloth and worn on the
person; sometimes they are written on the body itself, especially on
the part to be affected; occasionally they are written on a cup which
is then used for drinking purposes. Such prescriptions are infinite in
number, and are to be found in Malay charm-books, wedged in amongst
matter of a more strictly medical kind; in fact, it would be quite
correct to say that letter-charms (<i lang="ms">rajah</i>, <i lang=
"ms">&#703;azimat</i>) and sacred names have their place in the Malay
Pharmacop&oelig;ia side by side with spices, herbs, roots, and the
like. But such charms are also used for many other purposes: &ldquo;to
ward off demons (<i lang="ms">sheitan</i>), to make children feed at
the breast properly, to prevent them from crying and from going into
convulsions, to prevent the rice-crops from being devoured by pigs,
rats, and maggots,&rdquo; are consecutive instances of the charms
contained in a page of one of the numerous Malay treatises on these
matters. It would, from the nature of the case, be utterly impossible
to exhaust this endless subject, and it is not necessary to dwell upon
it at greater length, as the details of the charms used (of which a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb568" href="#pb568" name=
"pb568">568</a>]</span>few are quoted in the Appendix) do not as a rule
offer any features of general interest.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e30569src" href="#xd21e30569" name="xd21e30569src">251</a></p>
<p class="par">Far more interesting is that form of the Black Art which
attempts to &ldquo;abduct,&rdquo; or in some way &ldquo;get at&rdquo;
another person&rsquo;s soul, whether (as in the case of the ordinary
love-charm), in order to influence it in the operator&rsquo;s favour,
or, on the other hand, with a view to doing the victim some harm, which
may take the form of madness, disease, or even death.</p>
<p class="par">These results can be arrived at by a variety of methods:
in some of them the influence works entirely without contact, in others
there is some sort of contact between the victim and the receptacle
into which his soul is to be enticed. A few specimens of the methods
employed will conclude this part of the subject; they are necessarily
somewhat of a miscellaneous character; but it will be seen that they
are really only different applications of the same general principle,
the nature of which has already been indicated in the section on the
Soul.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e30576src" href="#xd21e30576" name=
"xd21e30576src">252</a></p>
<p class="par">The following is an instance of direct contact between
the soul receptacle and its owner&rsquo;s body&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take soil from the centre of the footprint
(<i lang="ms">hati-hati tapak</i>) of the person you wish to charm, and
&lsquo;treat it ceremonially&rsquo; (<i lang="ms">di-puja</i>) for
about three days.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The &lsquo;ceremonial treatment&rsquo; consists
in wrapping it up in pieces of red, black, and yellow cloth<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e30599src" href="#xd21e30599" name=
"xd21e30599src">253</a> (the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb569" href=

it from the centre of your mosquito-curtain with parti-coloured thread
(<i lang="ms">p&#277;nggantong-nya b&#277;nang pancharona</i>). It will
then become (the domicile of) your victim&rsquo;s soul (<i lang=
"ms">jadi s&#277;mangat</i>). You must, however, to complete the
ceremony, switch it with a birch of seven leaf-ribs taken from a
&lsquo;green&rsquo; cocoa-nut (<i lang="ms">p&#277;nyembat-nya lidi
niyor hijau tujoh &rsquo;lei</i>) seven times at sundown, seven times
at midnight, and seven times at sunrise, continuing this for three
days, and saying as you do so:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&lsquo;It is not earth that I switch,</p>
<p class="line">But the heart of <i>So-and-so</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<div lang="ms" class="lg">
<p class="line">(<i>Bukan-nya aku m&#277;nyembat tanah,</i></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Then bury it in the middle of a path where
your victim is sure to step over it (<i lang="ms">supaya buleh
di-langkah-nya</i>), and he will certainly become distraught. The only
taboo in connection with it is that you should let no one share your
sleeping-mat.&rdquo; The soul-receptacle in this case is the lump of
earth taken from the centre of the victim&rsquo;s footprint. It is said
to actually &ldquo;become (the victim&rsquo;s) soul,&rdquo; but no
doubt this is merely figurative, though it completely proves the
identification of the soul with its receptacle in the Malay mind. The
object of the birching is not self-evident, but may be intended to
dispel evil influences, and so purify it for the incoming soul.</p>
<p class="par">Another way of obtaining the required result is to
scrape off some of the wood of the floor from the place where your
intended victim has been sitting. Having secured this, take some of the
soil from his or her footprint and mix them both together with wax from
a deserted bees&rsquo; comb, moulding the figure into his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb570" href="#pb570" name="pb570">570</a>]</span>or
her likeness. Fumigate it with incense, and &ldquo;beckon&rdquo; to the
soul by waving a cloth (<i lang="ms">lambei s&#277;mangat</i>) every
night for three nights successively, reciting this charm:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">Take parings of nails, hair, eyebrows, saliva, etc. of
your intended victim (sufficient to represent every part of his
person), and make them up into his likeness with wax from a deserted

<p class="par">The description of the next ceremony is taken word for
word from a charm-book which I obtained from a Langat Malay (named
&rsquo;Che Indut), and which is still in my possession. As it
illustrates several new points about these wax figures, and as such
charms are exceedingly rare and all but impossible to obtain, I here
give a word for word translation of the whole text, the original Malay
version of which will be found in the Appendix:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e30708src" href="#xd21e30708" name=
"xd21e30708src">254</a>&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This refers to making images to harm people. You
make an image to resemble a corpse out of wax <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb571" href="#pb571" name="pb571">571</a>]</span>from
an empty bees&rsquo; comb,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e30720src" href=
"#xd21e30720" name="xd21e30720src">255</a> and of the length of a
footstep. If you want to cause sickness, you pierce the eye and
blindness results; or you pierce the waist and the stomach (lit. the
waist) gets sick, or you pierce the head and the head gets sick, or you
pierce the breast and the breast gets sick. If you want to cause death,
you transfix it from the head right through to the buttocks, the
&lsquo;transfixer&rsquo; being a <i lang="ms">gomuti</i>-palm<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e30726src" href="#xd21e30726" name=
"xd21e30726src">256</a> twig; then you enshroud the image as you would
a corpse, and you pray over it as if you were praying over the dead;
then you bury it in the middle of the path (which goes to) the place of
the person whom you wish to charm, so that he may step across it. This
refers to when you want to bury the image&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Peace be to you! Ho, Prophet &rsquo;Tap, in
whose charge the earth is,</p>
<p class="line">Lo, I am burying the corpse of <i>Somebody</i>,</p>
<p class="line">I am bidden (to do so) by the Prophet Muhammad,</p>
<p class="line">Because he (the corpse) was a rebel to God.</p>
<p class="line">Do you assist in killing him or making him sick:</p>
<p class="line">If you do not make him sick, if you do not kill
him,</p>
<p class="line">You shall be a rebel against God,</p>
<p class="line">A rebel against Muhammad.</p>
<p class="line">It is not I who am burying him,</p>

<p class="line">Grant it by the grace of my petition within the fold of
the Creed <i lang="ms">La ilaha</i>,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">There are, as I have said, several new points to
be got from this charm. You must make the image resemble a corpse; you
must make it of the length of the footstep (doubtless that of the
intended victim); <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb572" href="#pb572"
name="pb572">572</a>]</span>you must pierce the part which you want to
affect; if you want to kill your man, you must transfix him from the
head downwards with the twig of a <i lang="ms">gomuti</i>-palm (that is
to say, with one of the black splinters used as pens by the
Malays<a class="noteref" id="xd21e30777src" href="#xd21e30777" name=
"xd21e30777src">257</a>); you must <i>wrap the image in a shroud, and
read the burial service over it</i>; and, finally, in order to absolve
yourself from blood-guiltiness, you shift the burden of your crime on
to the shoulders of the Archangel Gabriel!!!</p>
<p class="par">There are, of course, many slight variations of the
actual ceremony. Sometimes the wizard, during the insertion of the pins
into the image, exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;It is not wax that I slay<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="line">But the liver, heart, and spleen of
<i>So-and-so</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">And then, after &ldquo;waving&rdquo; the figure in
the smoke of the incense, and depositing it in the centre of a
sacrificial tray (<i>anchak</i>), he invites the spirits to banquet
upon his victim&rsquo;s body:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I do not banquet you upon anything

<p class="par">&ldquo;Make the wax figure in the usual way and with the

<p class="par">Make two of the wax figures in the ordinary way, but
taking care that one resembles the husband and the other the wife. Sit
down with your legs stretched out before you, and hold the figures face

repetition breathe upon their heads. Then lay the man upon the ground
on your right side close to your thigh, but looking away from it; and
the woman at the side of the left thigh in a similar position, so that
they both look away from each other. Then burn incense and recite the
same charm twenty-two times over the man and twenty-two times over the
woman. Now put them back to back, and wrap them up in seven thicknesses
of the leaves of <i lang="ms">tukas</i>,<a class="noteref" id=

repeat the charm and bury them. Dig them up after seven days and see if
they are still there. If you find them the charm has failed, but if
not, it will work, and they will assuredly be divorced. The charm runs

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It will be noticed that a general similarity underlies
these several methods of soul-abduction in spite of their apparent
variety, and the diversity of the objects in view in the different
cases. On this point it is impossible to enlarge here: the purpose of
this book has been primarily to collect authentic specimens of the
various magic practices in vogue among the Malays of the Malay
Peninsula, and to indicate the nature of the beliefs on which these
practices are based, leaving it for others to draw from them such
inferences and to make such comparisons as may throw further light on
the subject. It has not been deemed desirable to anticipate such
inferences and comparisons here; but, without trespassing beyond the
scope of the present work, it may be noticed that there is a special
appropriateness in concluding it with the above account of the various
methods of soul-abduction. From them, taken together with what has
already been said on the subject,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e31232src"
href="#xd21e31232" name="xd21e31232src">264</a> a fairly complete idea
can be gathered of the Malay conception of the Soul; and it is hardly
too much to say that this conception is the central feature of the
whole system of Malay magic and folklore, from which all the different
branches with their various applications appear to spring.</p>
<p class="par">The root-idea seems to be an all-pervading Animism,
involving a certain common vital principle (<i lang=
"ms">s&#277;mangat</i>) in Man and Nature, which, for want of a more
suitable word, has been here called the Soul. The application of this
general theory of the universe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb580"
href="#pb580" name="pb580">580</a>]</span>to the requirements of the
individual man constitutes the Magic Art, which, as conceived by the
Malays, may be said to consist of the methods by which this Soul,
whether in gods, men, animals, vegetables, minerals, or what not, may
be influenced, captured, subdued, or in some way made subject to the
will of the magician.</p>
<p class="par">It would, however, probably be a mistake to push this
analysis too far; for side by side with the theory of a universe
animated by souls, which by the use of the appropriate words and forms
can be cajoled or threatened, there are the ideas of Luck and Ill-luck,
and the notion, strong in Muhammadans all over the world, of a
preordained course of events. Sometimes, presumably in extreme cases,
there is no escape from this destiny: if a man is fated to die at a
certain time, die he must, whatever he may do. But to a great extent
ill-luck can be avoided if one knows how; though we cannot stop it, we
need not expose ourselves to its influence. Thus a particular hour may
be unlucky for the doing of a certain act; but if we know that it is
so, we need not incur the danger.</p>
<p class="par">There are, therefore, for a Malay three alternatives, it
would seem: viz. Charms, for occasions where moral pressure can be
brought to bear; Divination, to assist in detecting dangers which in
the ordinary course must come but can be avoided; and, finally,
Isl&#257;m (Resignation), when he has to meet the inevitable, whether
it be regarded as the course of Fate or the eternal purpose of God.

&ldquo;To return to the elemental spirits, it was explained to me by a
Malay, with whom I discussed the subject at leisure, that apart from
the spirits which are an object of reverence, and which when treated
with proper deference are usually beneficent, there are a variety of
others. To begin with, spirits (the word used on this occasion was
<i lang="ms">hantu</i>) are of at least two kinds&mdash;wild ones,
whose normal habitat is the jungle, and those that are, so to say,
domesticated. The latter, which seem to correspond to what in Western
magic are called &lsquo;familiars,&rsquo; vary in character with their
owners or the persons to whom they are attached. Thus in this
particular village of Bukit S&#277;nggeh, a few years ago, there was a
good deal of alarm on account of the arrival of two or three strangers
believed to be of bad character, who were supposed to keep a familiar
spirit of a peculiarly malignant disposition, which was in the habit of
attacking people in their sleep by throttling them. One or two cases of
this kind occurred, and it was seriously suggested that I should make
the matter the subject of a magisterial inquiry, which, however, I did
not find it necessary to do. But the familiar spirits are by no means
necessarily evil.... The chief point of importance is to keep these
wild spirits in their proper place, viz. the jungle, and to prevent
them taking up their abode in the villages. For this reason charms are
hung up at the borders of the villages, and whenever a wild spirit
breaks bounds and encroaches on human habitations it is necessary to
get him turned out.&rdquo;&mdash;Blagden in <i>J.R.A.S.</i>,

&ldquo;In all parts of the Peninsula the <i>Bajang is said to be of the
male gender</i>, while the <i lang="ms">Langsuir</i> is supposed to be
a female. It is usually believed by Malays that the <i lang=
"ms">Bajang</i> is merely a malignant spirit which haunts mankind, and
whose presence foretells disaster. In Perak and some other parts of the
Peninsula, however, the <i lang="ms">Bajang</i> is regarded as one of
the several kinds of demons which, the Malays hold, can be enslaved by
man and become his familiar spirit. Such familiars, it is believed, are
handed down in certain families as heirlooms. The master of the
familiar is said to keep it imprisoned in a <i lang="ms">tabong</i>, or
vessel made from a joint of the bamboo, which is closed by a stopper
made from the leaves of the <i lang="la">Cotyledon laciniata</i>, the
<i lang="ms">Daun ch&#277;kar bebek</i>, or <i lang="ms">Daun
sadingin</i>, as they are variously termed by the Malays. Both the case
and the stopper are prepared by certain magic arts before they can be
employed in this way. The familiar is fed with eggs and milk. When its
master wishes to make use of it he sends it forth to possess and prey
upon the vitals of any one whom his malice may select as a victim. The
individual thus persecuted is at once seized by a deadly and
unaccountable ailment, which can only be cured by magic agencies. If
the <i lang="ms">Bajang</i> is neglected by its owner, and if the
latter omits to feed it regularly, it is said that he often falls a
victim to his own familiar.&rdquo;&mdash;Clifford and Swett., <i>Mal.

<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;He (Mr. M.) said, &lsquo;Very well then,
tell me about the <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i> only, I should like to
hear it and to write it down in English so that Europeans may know how
foolish those persons are who believe in such things.&rsquo; I then
drew a picture representing a woman&rsquo;s head and neck only, with
the intestines hanging down. Mr. M. caused this to be engraved on wood
by a Chinese, and inserted it with the story belonging to it in a
publication called the <i>Anglo-Chinese Gleaner</i>. And I said,
&lsquo;Sir, listen to the account of the <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i>.
It was originally a woman. She used the magic arts of a devil in whom
she believed, and she devoted herself to his service night and day
until the period of her agreement with her teacher had expired and she
was able to fly. Her head and neck were then loosened from the body,
the intestines being attached to them, and hanging down in strings. The
body remained where it was. Wherever the person whom it was wished to
injure happened to live, thither flew the head and bowels to suck his
blood, and the person whose blood was sucked was sure to die. If the
blood and water which dripped from the intestines touched any person,
serious illness immediately followed and his body broke out in open
sores. The <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i> likes to suck the blood of
women in childbirth. For this reason it is customary at all houses
where a birth occurs to hang up <i lang="ms">jeruju</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17845src" href="#xd21e17845" name=
"xd21e17845src">11</a> leaves at the doors and windows, or to place
thorns wherever there is any blood, lest the <i lang=
"ms">penanggalan</i> should come and suck it, for the <i lang=
"ms">penanggalan</i> has, it seems, a dread of thorns in which her
intestines may happen to get caught. It is said that a <i lang=
"ms">penanggalan</i> once came to a man&rsquo;s house in the middle of
the night to suck his blood, and her intestines were caught in some
thorns near the hedge, and she had to remain there until daylight, when
the people saw and killed her.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;&lsquo;The person who has the power of
becoming a <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i> always keeps at her house a
quantity of vinegar in a jar or vessel of some kind. The use of this is
to soak the intestines in, for when they issue forth from the body they
immediately swell up and cannot be put back, but after being soaked in
vinegar they shrink to their former size and enter the body again.
There are many people who have seen the <i lang="ms">penanggalan</i>
flying along with its entrails dangling down and shining at night like
fire-flies.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;&lsquo;Such is the story of the <i lang=

&ldquo;The origin of the Polong is this:&mdash;The blood of a murdered
man must be taken and placed in a bottle (<i lang="ms">buli-buli</i>, a
bottle having a spherical or wide body and a long narrow neck). Then
prayers are said over it, and something or other is read, I don&rsquo;t
know what, but it has to be learnt. After seven days of this worship,
according to some people, or after twice seven days according to
others, a sound is heard in the bottle like the chirping of young
birds. The operator then cuts his finger and inserts it into the bottle
and the Polong sucks it. The person who thus supports the Polong is
called his father, or, if it happens to be a woman, she is his mother.
Every day the parent feeds it with his (or her) blood. The object of
doing this and the advantage to be gained from it are these:&mdash;if
he entertains a feeling of anger against any one he orders the Polong
to go and afflict him, that is to say, to cause him pain or sickness;
or if a third person is at enmity with another he goes in secret to the
person who keeps the Polong, and gives him a sum of money to send the
Polong to attack the person against whom he bears ill-will. This is the
use of it. The person who is tormented by the Polong, whether a virgin,
or a married woman, or a man, cries out and loses consciousness of what
he (or she) is doing, and tears and throws off his (or her) clothing,
biting and striking the people near, blind and deaf to everything, and
does all sorts of other things. Wise men are called in to prescribe
remedies; some come and chant formulas over the head of the patient,
others pinch his thumb and apply medicines to it. When the remedy is
successful the sick person cries out, &lsquo;Let me go, I want to go
home.&rsquo; The doctor replies, &lsquo;I will not let you go if you do
not make known who it is that has sent you here, and why you have come,
and who are your father and mother.&rsquo; Sometimes he (the Polong in
the patient) remains silent and will not confess or give the names of
his parents; sometimes he confesses, and says &lsquo;Let me go, my
father is such-a-one and lives at such-and-such a <i lang=
"ms">kampong</i>, and my mother is so-and-so. The reason that I have
come here is that such-a-one came to my parents and asked for their
aid, and gave them a sum of money because he bore ill-will against this
person&rsquo; (or whatever the reason may have been). Sometimes he
makes a false statement, and mentions entirely wrong persons in order
to conceal the names of his parents. As soon as the people know the
name of the person who has contrived the attack and the reason, they
let him go, and the sick person at once recovers his consciousness, but
he is left weak and feeble. When a Polong attacks a person and will
confess nothing, the person who is attacked shrieks and yells in anger,
and after a day or two he dies. After death blood pours forth bubbling
(<i lang="ms">ber-kopak-kopak</i>) from the mouth, and the whole body
is blue with bruises.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Hikayat Abdullah</i>, p. 143.

(incantations), and bending forward try to embrace your shadow. If you
fail, try again several times, repeating more incantations. If not
successful, go the next night and make a further effort, and the night
after, if necessary&mdash;three nights in all. If you cannot then catch
your shadow, wait till the same day on the following month and renew
the attempt. Sooner or later you will succeed, and, as you stand there
in the brilliance of the moonlight, you will see that you have drawn
your shadow into yourself, and your body will never again cast a shade.
Go home, and in the night, whether sleeping or waking, the form of a
child will appear before you and put out its tongue; that seize, and it
will remain while the rest of the child disappears. In a little while
the tongue will turn into something that breathes, a small animal,
reptile, or insect, and when you see the creature has life put it in a

upon to do so, and when the confinement is over she can claim other
moneys in payment of her services. These latter fees are not ruinously
high, according to our standard, two dollars being charged for
attending a woman in her first confinement, a dollar or a dollar and a

Besides the tray containing the articles described, there stood at one

consists of a tray full of unhusked rice surmounted by a tray full of
husked rice and a roughly-husked cocoa-nut (<i lang="ms">niyor

cocoa-nut referred to is encircled by a hank of &ldquo;Java&rdquo;
thread (<i lang="ms">b&#277;nang Jawa</i>), which is said to avert
injury to the tooth-filer&rsquo;s eyes whenever, as sometimes happens,

of yarn being used by the Pawang to wipe his eyes should any harm to

&ldquo;Both sexes have the extraordinary custom of filing and otherwise
disfiguring their teeth, which are naturally very white and beautiful,
from the simplicity of their food. For files they make use of small
whetstones, and the patients lie on their backs during the operation.
Many, particularly the women of the Lampong country, have their teeth
rubbed down quite even with the gums; others have them formed in
points, and some file off no more than the outer coat and extremities
in order that they may the better receive and retain the jetty
blackness with which they almost universally adorn them. The black used
on these occasions is the empyreumatic oil of the cocoa-nut shell. When
this is not applied the filing does not, by destroying what we term the
enamel, diminish the whiteness of the teeth.... The great men sometimes
set theirs in gold by casing with a plate of that metal the under row;
and this ornament, contrasted with the black dye, has, by lamp or
candle light, a very splendid effect. It is sometimes indented to the
shape of the teeth, but more usually quite plain. They do not remove it
either to eat or sleep.&rdquo;&mdash;Marsden, <i>Hist. of Sumatra</i>

&ldquo;marriage.&rdquo; Words describing the married state with
reference to one of the parties only, however, are in frequent use:
such as the <i lang="ms">b&#277;rsuami</i> and <i lang=

of the two parties or to both, and is the politest word that can be

&ldquo;At their funerals the corpse is carried to the place of
interment on a broad plank, which is kept for the public service of the
<i lang="ms">dusun</i>, and lasts for generations. It is constantly
rubbed with lime, either to preserve it from decay or to keep it pure.
No coffin is made use of, the body being simply wrapped in white cloth,
particularly of the sort called <i lang="ms">hummums</i>. In forming
the grave (<i lang="ms">kubur</i>), after digging to a convenient depth
they make a cavity in the side, at bottom, of sufficient dimensions to
contain the body, which is there deposited on its right side. By this
mode the earth literally lies light upon it; and the cavity, after
strewing flowers in it, they stop up by two boards fastened angularly
to each other, so that the one is on the top of the corpse, whilst the
other defends it on the open side, the edge resting on the bottom of
the grave. The outer excavation is then filled up with earth; and
little white flags, or streamers, are stuck in order around. They
likewise plant a shrub, bearing a white flower, called <i lang=
"ms">kumbangkamboja</i> (<i lang="la">Plumeria obtusa</i>), and in some
places wild marjoram. The women who attend the funeral make a hideous
noise, not much unlike the Irish howl. On the third and seventh day the
relations perform a ceremony at the grave, and at the end of twelve
months that of <i lang="ms">tegga batu</i>, or setting up a few long
elliptical stones, at the head and foot, which, being scarce in some
parts of the country, bear a considerable price. On this occasion they
kill and feast on a buffalo, and leave the head to decay on the spot,
as a token of the honour they have done to the deceased in eating to
his memory. The ancient burying-places are called <i lang=
"ms">krammat</i>, and are supposed to have been those of the holy men
by whom their ancestors were converted to the faith. They are held in
extraordinary reverence, and the least disturbance or violation of the
ground, though all traces of the graves be obliterated, is regarded as
an unpardonable sacrilege,&rdquo;&mdash;Marsden, <i>Hist. of

Tradition says that formerly the corpse was watched for three days
before burial, and that sometimes it was kept for a week or even a
longer period. One Raja S&rsquo;nei is reported to have been kept 40
days in her coffin above ground! It is also stated that before the
introduction of Muhammadanism the dead were burned.</p>
<p class="par footnote">It is still the custom to keep both the
hearth-fire (<i lang="ms">api dapor</i>) and lamps (<i lang=

the house, but for seven days and nights after occurrence of the death.
It is also the custom to open the sick person&rsquo;s mosquito-curtain
when death is approaching, and in some cases, at all events, the dying
are taken out of their beds and laid upon the floor. I may add that the
material for fumigation (<i lang="ms">p&#277;rabun</i>) is placed upon
the hearth-fire after death, to scare away the evil spirits, just as
salt is thrown upon the fire during a thunderstorm, in order that it
may counteract the explosions of thunder (<i lang="ms">m&#277;mbalas

<i>Influence of the Breath in Healing.</i>&mdash;In Notes and Queries,
No. 1, p. 24, a Malay <i lang="ms">bomor</i>, or doctor, is described
as blowing upon something to be used as medicine. Breathing upon sick
persons and upon food, water, medicines, etc., to be administered to
them is a common ceremony among Malay doctors and midwives. The

their Muhammadan teachers:&mdash;</p>

miraculous cures of the Messiah were, according to Moslems, mostly
performed by aspiration. They hold that in the days of Isa, physic had

&ldquo;I have said that all birds fight more or less, but birds are not
alone in this. The little, wide-mouthed, goggled-eyed fishes, which
Malay ladies keep in bottles and old kerosine tins, fight like demons.
Goats sit up and strike with their cloven hoofs, and butt and stab with
their horns. The silly sheep canter gaily to the battle, deliver
thundering blows on one another&rsquo;s foreheads, and then retire and
charge once more. The impact of their horny foreheads is sufficient to
reduce a man&rsquo;s hand to a shapeless pulp should it find its way
between the combatants&rsquo; skulls. Tigers box like pugilists, and
bite like French school-boys; and buffaloes fight clumsily, violently,

&ldquo;The original Javanese week, like that of the Mexicans, consists
of five days, and its principal use, like that of the same people, is
to determine the markets or fairs held in the principal villages or
districts. This arbitrary period has probably no better foundation than
the relation of the numbers to that of the fingers of the hand. The
names of the days of this week are as follows:&mdash;<i lang=
"ms">L&#259;ggi</i>, <i lang="ms">Pahing</i>, <i lang="ms">Pon</i>,
<i lang="ms">Wagi</i>, <i lang="ms">Kliwon</i>.... The Javanese
consider the names of the days of their native week to have a mystical
relation to colours, and to the divisions of the horizon.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;According to this whimsical
interpretation, the first means <i>white</i>, and the <i>east</i>; the
second, <i>red</i>, and the <i>south</i>; the third, <i>yellow</i>, and
the <i>west</i>; the fourth<span class="corr" id="xd21e28507" title=

<i>mixed</i> colour, and <i>focus</i>, or centre. It is highly probable
that, like the week of the continental nations of Asia and Europe, the
days were named after the national gods. In an ancient manuscript found
in Java, which will be afterwards referred to, the week of five days is
represented by five human figures, two of which are female and three
male.&rdquo;&mdash;Crawfurd, <i>Hist. of the Indian Archipelago</i>,

those of medicine (<i>v.</i> pp. 452&ndash;456, <i>supra</i>); but the

explanation of this ceremony is that the shadow is supposed in some way
to embody or at least represent the soul. Thus the female reapers of
the first ripe <i lang="ms">padi</i> are specially enjoined to reap in
a straight line facing the sun, so that their shadow may not fall upon
the rice-soul in the basket at their sides (<i>vide</i> pp.
242&ndash;244, <i>supra</i>). No doubt the speaker&rsquo;s shadow-soul
is expected to fetch the woman&rsquo;s body-soul, and the beating of
the shadow-soul is perhaps purely ceremonial, to drive away evil
influences from it, before it starts on its journey, but this latter
suggestion is merely conjectural. The first line of the charm, however,
in which the speaker addresses his shadow by name (Irupi) as he strikes
it with the cane, points out most clearly the connection between the
body-soul (or puppet-soul) and the shadow-soul, to which I have
referred. The coverlet or white cloth is no doubt the soul-cloth, into
which the woman&rsquo;s soul is expected to enter when it
arrives.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e30981src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p lang="en" class="par first">The Malays believe that it is very bad
for one to be awakened suddenly, and even when one coolie is waking
another, he does so with the greatest gentleness, calling him softly by
his name in an ever varying tone until he has succeeded in awaking him.
Rajas and Chiefs are never aroused until they wake naturally. The
European passion of being called in the morning is regarded by the
Malays as only one more symptom of the madness which is known to
possess these people.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e31852src" href=

received in a cleft stick (<i lang="ms">sepit</i>), and after being
dried is made up into a sort of ring, and used as a charm to secure
invulnerability (<i lang="ms">pelias</i>) in war, or else carried out
on a piece of banana leaf and thrown away with ashes from the hearth

<p class="par first"><i>Senna</i>.&mdash;As an example of the present
state of medical science among the Malays, the following translation of
instructions for the use of a well-known drug may be of interest. It
will be seen that it cures as many diseases as some of the patent pills
of modern advertisements. The mention of grapes, dates, and
pomegranates as ingredients may show that the Malay prescription is
itself a translation from Indian or Arabic sources:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is designed to explain the virtues of the
senna of Mecca (<i>daun sana-makki</i>), which is famous among all
doctors of experience.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>First</i>. Take some senna leaves with their
stalks and bark, pound the whole up fine, and then weigh out a quantity
as heavy as three Java duits. Let this be mixed with honey. If this is
swallowed, its properties are to cause all diseases of the chest to
disappear.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Second</i>. Mix the senna leaves with moist
sugar. If this is taken internally, the effect is to expel cold from
the body and to give strength to the organs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Third</i>. Mix the senna leaves with sugar
candy. This gives strength to the bones.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Fourth</i>. Mix the senna leaves with
clarified butter and moist sugar. If this is taken for three days it
will get rid of all bad humours in the body, and will give health.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Fifth</i>. Mix the senna leaves with fresh
butter to which no salt has yet been added. The properties of this
mixture are to cure headaches and to cleanse the brain and to remove
any bad taste in the mouth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Sixth</i>. Mix the senna leaves with curds.
This mixture operates as an antidote to poison and prevents evil
consequences from it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Seventh</i>. If senna be taken with
goat&rsquo;s milk, it will cause an accession of strength, though
complete weakness existed just before.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Eighth</i>. If senna be taken with dates,
everything offensive is removed from the mouth, and the body is made
healthy, and a good appetite is established.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Ninth</i>. If senna be taken with
pomegranates, the body becomes strong, and though the patient may be
old, nevertheless there is an addition of strength, and the organs of
the chest are cleansed, and the appetites are stimulated.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Tenth</i>. If senna be taken with grapes, it
gives light to the eyes which were dim. This is proved by
experience.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Eleventh</i>. If senna be drunk with vinegar,
it cures fever accompanied by shivering and trembling of the bones, and
expels all mischief from the stomach, and cleanses the organs of the
chest.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Twelfth</i>. If senna leaves be taken with
orange juice, all internal heat is removed, and a man who was before
quite thin will speedily grow fat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Thirteenth</i>. If senna is drunk with dew,
the eyes become bright and clear.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Fourteenth</i>. If senna is taken in water in
which pomegranate peel has been boiled, it cures dysentery.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Fifteenth</i>. If senna is boiled with
cocoa-nut water and taken internally, it will cure diabetes and gravel,
by the will of God ever to be praised and Most High.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Thus the properties of the senna of Mecca are concluded
under fifteen headings.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e42811src" href=

K&rsquo;ris</i> <span class="pref">[p. <a href="#pb530" class=
"pageref">530</a>.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">1. Measure the <i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i> from
the bottom of the blade (in the centre) to the point with a thin strip
of cocoa-nut leaf about half an inch wide. Cut the strip to this length
and fold it trebly; notch one of the third parts at the fold; measure
off the length of the two remaining thirds on the blade from the bottom
towards the point, and mark the blade at this distance. Then measure
off the remaining third round the blade at this mark as
follows:&mdash;See that its extreme end exactly coincides with the left
side of the blade, and stretch it across the blade at right angles,
bending the strip of leaf round the edge at the exact spot reached on
the opposite edge of the blade by making a dent but not severing the
leaf. Then measure it a second time from the dent thus made, making a
second dent on the strip at the point reached. Repeat this a third
time, making a third dent, when the dent on the strip of leaf should be
found to come exactly in the centre of the blade, if the blade is a
good one.</p>
<p class="par">If it falls on either side it is bad, and if it requires
four measurements (instead of three) it is very bad, though five would
be good. There will never be more than five.</p>
<p class="par">This measurement is called the Malay measurement
(<i lang="ms">Ukoran Malayu</i>) as distinguished from</p>
<p class="par">2. The Bugis&rsquo; measurement (<i lang="ms">Ukoran
Bugis</i>), which is made nearer the hilt, as follows:&mdash;Begin as
before, but measure off the remaining two-thirds from the point instead
of the hilt. This will give a mark farther up the blade, and the strip
of leaf must then be folded round the <i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i> to
see where the notch (between <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb655" href=
"#pb655" name="pb655">655</a>]</span>the second and third divisions)
will come on the blade. The number of times which the breadth of the
<i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i> will go into the third division is now of
no importance. Merely measure from the end of the third division as
before, continuing until the notch is right over the blade. If it comes
at the left side of the blade it is good, but if in the centre or on
the right it is unlucky.</p>
<p class="par">3. Another method, called <i lang="ms">Ukor Toh Mujud
Dato&rsquo; Lukut</i> (the measurement of Toh Mujud, chief or founder
of Lukut), is used especially by Selangor Malays. The story goes that
Toh Mujud&rsquo;s wife was unfaithful with a Kedah man, and that her
husband, being jealous to desperation, searched everywhere in vain for
a <i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i> which would settle his adversary. At
length, however, in a dream a vision appeared to him, and told him to
look for a <i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris sapukal</i> in the possession of a
man who was digging up <i lang="ms">r&#277;mis</i> or <i lang=
"ms">tepeh</i> (a kind of mollusc?). Toh Mujud went accordingly to look
for the man, and on meeting with one so occupied at Pulau Labuhan
Bilek, near Tanjong Tuan, found that he had a very old and rusty
<i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i>, which he thereupon bought from him for 25
cents. Armed with this <i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i> Toh Mujud then
found and slew his adversary, and the proportions of the lucky weapon
corresponded with the measurement here given.</p>
<p class="par">Fold the string or strip of leaf, and cut it in half.
Take one of the halves, fold it, and measure from the point upwards as
far as it will go. Mark the spot, and measure off the string in
breadths of the <i lang="ms">k&rsquo;ris</i> at that spot: there must
be ten breadths, and at the measuring of the tenth the end of the
string must be in the centre of the blade, if it is to be of any
use.</p>
<p class="par">Then take the other half, fold it also in two, and
measure up from the bottom of the blade as far as the folded string
will go: there must be seven breadths of the blade in the length of the
half string, and the end of the string should come within a
hair&rsquo;s-breadth of the edge of the blade, or, as the Malays say,
&ldquo;leaving space for an ant to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">4. Another method is known as the <i lang="ms">Ukoran
G&#277;nap</i>, or <i lang="ms">Ukor Mandar</i> (of Celebes).</p>
<p class="par">Fold the string in two, and measure off the half-length
thus obtained on the blade, commencing at the bottom. Then see how many
times the breadth of the blade is contained in the whole length of the
string, which should be <i>fourteen</i>.</p>
<p class="par">5. Another way of measuring, to see how many
thumbs&rsquo;-breadths there are in the length of the blade, is as
follows. It is not considered of much importance:&mdash;Lay the right
thumb across the foot of the blade near the hilt, and the thumb of the
left hand also on the blade immediately above the other; continue
placing the thumbs alternately one in front of the other until the
point is reached, repeating for the first thumb&rsquo;s-breadth the
word <i lang="ms">gunong</i> (mountain), for the second <i lang=
"ms">runtoh</i> (fall), for the third <i lang="ms">madu</i> (honey),
for the fourth <i lang="ms">s&#277;gara</i> (ocean), after which
recommence with <i lang="ms">gunong</i>, and so on. If <i lang=
"ms">gunong</i> or <i lang="ms">madu</i> brings the thumb to the point
the blade is a good one, but not if it is <i lang="ms">runtoh</i> or
<i lang="ms">s&#277;gara</i>.</p>
<p class="par">6. Another measurement is thus described:&mdash;Put the
tip of the right thumb upon the spot where the hilt joins the blade,
with the back of the first joint against the blade; next to this put
the left thumb horizontally across the blade, and continue to alternate
the first joint of the right thumb with the breadth of the left till
the point of the <i>k&rsquo;ris</i> is reached, repeating as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<i>Tanah kang</i>: explained as an allusion to that part of the lower
jaw which is beneath the tongue (<i>mulut di-bawah lidah</i>), the
intention evidently being to allude to the
&ldquo;pelesit&rsquo;s&rdquo; coming out of its owner&rsquo;s mouth. In
the next line but one, <i>tanah dengkang</i> is similarly explained as
alluding to the roof of the owner&rsquo;s month, so that asking the
&ldquo;pelesit&rdquo; to return to it is tantamount to requesting it to
fly back down its owner&rsquo;s throat. And thus, three lines later, it
is requested to return to its &ldquo;embodiment&rdquo;

limes emblematic of the vegetable creation, it was necessary to invoke
the three &ldquo;Prophets&rdquo; who are supposed to be in charge of
those departments of creation. The explanation, however, is not a
satisfactory one, and it is more probable that these lines have taken
the place of an older invocation now forgotten. Their Arabic character

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">NOTE ON THE WORD <i>KRAMAT</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following is an extract from a letter by the
author which was received too late for insertion in the text of the
book:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think that the best translation for
<i>kramat</i>, in the case of beasts, etc., is &lsquo;sacred.&rsquo; I
have been going into the <i>kramat</i> question, and it appears to me
that <i>kramat</i> animals, trees, and other objects occupy the same
place in Malay popular religion as is occupied by Totems in the popular
religion of other countries.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not wish to be understood (before going more
deeply still into the matter) that they <i>are</i> totems, but that
they possess, generally speaking, the same characteristics. They are
the bodily tenements or receptacles containing the souls of the
departed ancestors of the village. Incense is burnt and prayers are
offered to them (<i>e.g.</i> in the case of the sacred elephant), and
the mere fact of meeting them when one is engaged in a difficult
enterprise is believed to insure success. On the other hand, to kill or
wound them is to court disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">To the above I may add that <i>kramat</i> (which is a
word of Arabic derivation) properly appears to mean
&ldquo;sanctity,&rdquo; but is in Malay generally used adjectively,
being applied to men, animals, plants, stones, etc. When the word
stands alone it almost invariably means a holy <i>place</i>, the word
<i>t&#277;mpat</i> being presumably understood. When applied to a
person it implies special sanctity and miraculous power. I remember, in
1895, hearing of a little girl, living with her parents at Sungei Baru
in the Alor Gajah district of Malacca, who was reputed to be
<i>kramat</i>. People used to travel considerable distances in order to
visit her, and thereby gain some benefit or other. I was informed that
the <i>modus operandi</i> was to swallow a small quantity of her saliva
in a cup of water, but I never verified this statement. These
pilgrimages were rather disapproved of by the local Kathi, who was my
informant.</p>
<p class="par">As regards true totemism, I am not sure that it can be
traced among the Malays of the Peninsula, although a few elements of
the system are to be found here and there among them. Thus, for
instance, in certain districts (<i>e.g.</i> northern Malacca and the
Negri Sembilan) there are clans descending in the female line among
whom exogamy is still the rule, to the extent, at least, that
intermarriage is forbidden between the children of sisters
(<i>J.R.A.S., S.B.</i>, No. 23, p. 143); and we also sometimes find
tutelary or taboo animals, etc. more or less closely connected with
certain families; but these two sets of facts do not seem to be
interwoven as they appear to be among certain other races. Traces of
animals, etc. being regarded as specially connected with particular
families are not, I believe, very common: two instances occur in the
<i>S&#277;jarah Malayu</i>, viz. the man &ldquo;Bat&rsquo;h,&rdquo; who
emerged from foam vomited by a bull (<i>Malay Annals</i>, p. 23), and
who is regarded as the progenitor of the still existing Malay tribe
(Bangsa Muntah L&#277;mbu) of hereditary bards, to whom beef, milk,
etc. are taboo<a class="noteref" id="xd21e46853src" href="#xd21e46853"
name="xd21e46853src">1</a>; and the Indian prince &ldquo;Mani
Farendan&rdquo; (<i>ibid.</i> p. 110), who on his voyage to Malacca
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb674" href="#pb674" name=
"pb674">674</a>]</span>was preserved from drowning by the <i lang=
"ms">alu-alu</i> fish and the <i lang="ms">gandasuli</i> tree, and on
that account &ldquo;forbade all his descendants to eat of the fish
<i lang="ms">alu-alu</i> or to wear the flower of the <i lang=
"ms">gandasuli</i>.&rdquo; His descendants formed a noble family in
Malacca, the heads of which usually bore the title of <i lang=
"ms">S&rsquo;ri Naradiraja</i>, and during the 15th century
<span class="sc">A. D.</span> often held the highest offices of state;
so the legend may, probably enough, preserve the record of an actual
custom peculiar to that family. Both the above cases, however, seem to
be derived from a Hindu origin.</p>
<p class="par">The tutelary animals connected with holy (<i lang=
"ms">kramat</i>) places may perhaps sometimes be in point in this
connection: for instance, at Malacca Pindah, in Malacca territory, I
remember seeing the private burial-place of a certain family (which
lived close by), and being informed by the local village headman that,
whenever any member of that family died, certain tigers were in the
habit of wailing (<i lang="ms">m&#277;nangis</i>) round the place at
night.</p>
<p class="par">It has been observed by the author (pp. 71, 153, 163)
that <i>kramat</i> animals generally have some physical peculiarity,
such as a shrunken foot or stunted tusk; it may be added that they are
sometimes white (<i>i.e.</i> albino individuals of a species which is
not usually white), and thus marked out from their fellows by the
characteristic sacred colour. I remember reading in the local Straits
newspaper some years ago that a white mouse-deer, which was caught
somewhere in the Negri Sembilan, was regarded by the Malays as
<i>kramat</i>: very soon after its capture, I believe on the same
evening, it escaped from its cage overnight, a fact which no doubt
further corroborated the natives in their belief as to its sacred
character. I have little doubt that it was purposely released by some
superstitious Malay, who thought that no good would come of keeping a
sacred animal in captivity.</p>
